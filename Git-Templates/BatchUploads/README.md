# Batch directory

This is the folder that contains new easy access commit descriptions for image upload batches. This was started on March 7th 2021, and is estimated to save at least 1 hour of time by 2022.

GitHub limits uploads to 100 files, so I create sub-directories with 1-100 files and separate them into batches. The description is done through notes and gives general info. The description used to have to be written out by hand each time. With this batch collection, I can simply navigate to the directory, select all for the number of batches, and copy and paste each individual one, without any rewriting

I set the limit to 50, as I doubt I will have to go to more than 5000 files a day.
