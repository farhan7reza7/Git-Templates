# IGNORE.md

The `IGNORE.md` file is one of my most used files on GitHub.

## Purpose & usage

It is used solely to push a commit that creates an empty directory (as you can't just create empty directories on GitHub)

This is usually done for folders that require uploading of several files, or binary files that can't be pushed normally. The file is usually deleted after a release is published and there is another file in the folder.

## What to do

Do simply as the name implies and ignore the file. It will be deleted eventually, and if it isn't, it isn't a worry, as the file is less than 200 bytes in size.
