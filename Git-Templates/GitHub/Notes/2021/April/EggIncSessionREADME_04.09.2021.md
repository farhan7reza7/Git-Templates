# Egg Inc. session April 9th 2021

I had a very long session today and made lots of progress.

## Graviton egg

I am capable of upgrading to the next egg, but I worked on completing quests today instead.

## Quests

I did several quests today, and tried to make progress on the Chicken Universe quest (get 150 million chickens on your farm) I completed 4 other quests, and earned over 175K soul eggs, and over 7000 golden eggs.

## Boosts

I began experimenting with internal hatchery rate increases today, and enjoyed the 10x/100x boosts. I added over 100 million chickens to my farm today.

## Drone boost

I got the benefit of 4x drone bonus boosters today, although the games UI does not pair well with the fast drones, and I missed at least a dozen of them.

## Upgrades

I bought over 100 common upgrades today, and over 10 epic upgrades, working on internal hatchery rate, drone bonuses, Silo away time, and more.
