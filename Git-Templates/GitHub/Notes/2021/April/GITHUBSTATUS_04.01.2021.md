### April 1st 2021

I had an OK day today. I started with a clean slate of progress as it is a new month. Today, I released a non-traditional April Fools joke project, non-traditional as in it doesn't fool anyone (and if it does, I don't even) I created a project with joke branches, and branch puns. It is also to be used for GitHub branch experimentation.

I quickly archived 2 new monthly releases of my Khan Academy project in less than an hour. Today, I spent the rest of my morning, and a couple hours in the afternoon preparing my new laptop.

I made a "small" update, and added support for 80 new languages. It takes too long to translate them all at once, so I will try to translate 9-10 per day for the next 7-8 days.

I had a lot of procrastination issues today, and didn't get as much done as yesterday. However, I have been making my workload work in my favor as to geasier on myself tomorrow.

My new laptop is fully prepared except for Firefox profiles, video, and music.

I stayed up really late tonight and wasn't too functional. I hope for a better day tomorrow.

Today was a good day for development.
