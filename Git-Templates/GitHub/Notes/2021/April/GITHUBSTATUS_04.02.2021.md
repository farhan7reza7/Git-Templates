### Status update: April 2nd 2021

I forgot to upload my GitHub status file last night. A double upload was done tonight.

I had an OK day with development. I dealt with addiction problems, but still got a little bit of work done. I got some work done on forked projects, and did my daily documentation work, along with 12 new language translations to my GitHub profile README.md file.

I got my new laptop further set up today. I didn't think copying over Firefox profiles would be so easy, it was pretty much seamless. I successfully cloned my Firefox setup today. It is fully functional too. I was skeptical on what it was going to grab, but it got everything (that I can tell so far, except for 1 thing, I noted that it didn't get the `TITLEBAR=ENABLED` preference. I like it better without the titlebar, I didn't know you could just turn it off on Linux. It blends into the theme.

With my new backup laptop today, I have found out why I haven't been able to get some of the apps I wanted: apparently the Ubuntu store is different from the snap store. The reason why my applications weren't coming up was because I was searching from the snap store, because the Ubuntu store originally redirected me there. I have now customized it further and have stopped using the snap store. One unique program I overlooked was the help center application. I guess the icon was just too generic and I overlooked it. It really gives off Windows XP help center vibes to me (which I am very fond of) and it is an extremely helpful documentation center, not only for beginner and non-tech savvy users, but also for tech savvy and intermediate users.

I have been in the process of getting my projects ready for automation, starting yesterday. I have finally come to terms that the way I am doing things is inefficient, and I have found that automation will be the way to go for some projects. I will have to lay down some ground rules for myself (and possibly others) regarding this, as I shouldn't be 100% reliant on automation (or else bad things will start happening, such as programs becoming Google Translate translating through 1-1000 different languages level of quality) I will try to start laying out rules for that tomorrow.

Today was a OK day for development.
