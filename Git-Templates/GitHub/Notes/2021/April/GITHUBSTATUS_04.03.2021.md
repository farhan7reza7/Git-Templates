### Status update: April 3rd 2021

I forgot to upload my GitHub status file last night. A double upload was done tonight.

I had an OK day with development. I dealt with procrastination problems, and did my daily documentation work, and added 10 new language translations to my GitHub profile README.md file.

My new laptop is already experiencing new bad problems. I hate complaining about it, but it is important for documentation. Today, I noted that CPU usage was excessive, and I killed tracker-miner-fs, which did nothing to help. I noted that GNOME System Monitor was not reporting correct Daemon/process CPU usage. Most of my CPU cores were using over 22% CPU, yet the process list only showed a single process using 1.0-1.99% CPU, and everything else using <0.99% of the total CPU. I also noticed that Cache usage went up to a maximum of 6.3 GiB (6.76 GB) of memory, but it went down to 4.4 GiB (4.72 GB) when opening Firefox. Something is not right, although I learned more about tracker and how it works today when experimenting with the program. I killed it twice, and found that it now wants to reindex my entire laptop, but won't show more than 0 files being indexed. This issue currently is unresolved.

I had severe procrastination problems today, but got some work done on some projects, including my project automator project.

Today was a OK day for development.
