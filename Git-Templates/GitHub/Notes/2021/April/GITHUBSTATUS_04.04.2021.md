### Status update: April 4th 2021

My gaming sessions were excessive today, and I didn't expect them to be. I was hoping yesterday was the last difficult day of week. I had minor procrastination issues, but I did less work, as I need to go to bed earlier.

I had a really hard time sleeping last night. I didn't get to sleep until past 3:00 am, and I slept in past 12:00 pm (waking up at 12:03 pm) something that is extremely rare for me (2nd time in my life where I slept in past noon)

I got really tired during development and had to wrap up and go to bed. I have a meeting tomrrow morning. I was only abe to do 5 translations today, which is still over 3%

I forked and patially finalized some joke projects today, incluidng Branch Ranch and 404Day.

Today was a OK day for development.
