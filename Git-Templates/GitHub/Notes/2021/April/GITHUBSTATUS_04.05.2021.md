### Status update: April 5th 2021

I had an appointment with my therapist this morning. I won't go into the details.

I decided to do git-image work directly aferwards, along with other projects, before starting my gaming session. I made lots of progress before my gaming session, and a good amount of progress afterwards.

I have been bummed about this for about a week now but haven't mentioned it yet, but I do not like the flatter `README` index button on GitHub. Luckily, I have a copy of the original graphics in both light and dark modes.

Tomorrow may be a difficult day, due to the addicting game that is so addicting that I only allow myself to play it once a month (Idle Miner Tycoon)

I worked pretty heavily on updating the documentation for SNU Beliefs today. I was able to get some important resources and ideas to continue the project.

Today, I also torrented 1 file from archive.org, as the main site was going too slow, and I wanted to save bandwidth.

I did Organization work over Wiki work, I will try again either tomorrow or the day after to create project Wikis for 3 important projects.
 
My goal of going to bed earlier was set back today due to how late I stayed up. The fish tank video process hasn't been as enthusiastic lately, but I have gotten a lot done today other than that.

When creating organizations, I kept getting 404 errors thrown at me, and the forks were disapearing and re-appearing with each refresh. The issue eventually settled, and I don't plan on creating any new organizations for a while.
 
Today was a good day for development.
