### Status update: April 6th 2021

I had a good day with development today, despite the monthly addiction. I also had the time to make 10 new translations of my GitHub profile.

Today was the first Tuesday of the month, so I had my planned long Idle Miner Tycoon session. It felt like I was going to be done by 3:00 pm, but I got sucked in further and played until 4:59 pm. It affected GitHub progress today, but I still remained as productive as I could be via dualtasking. This is why I took the risk and got more done yesterday, so that there would be less to focus on today.

I had time to create more commit description batch files today, something I am still behind on. It was required due to the massive amount of batch uploads today.

I got the usual Git-image work done, then went to complete my journaling. I am still behind on updating my marine biology research project (update: I got to this tonight)

SNU has been getting extra development attention lately, I am hoping this will result in a return to normal soon.

Today was an OK day for development.
