### Status update: April 7th 2021

I had a good day with development today. Last night, I got feedback on my profile README project about how to continue it with `.gitattributes` which I spent some time researching, testing, and observing today. Along with this, I finished my V9 GitHub profile README.md file translation project, translating the last 22 languages today, with 110 languages now translated. The task is now up-to-date, with no links leading to a 404 page. I have had a lot of time today.

I Worked late again tonight, I am still failing on getting my schedule under control. I had a lot of time to work today, and had brief issues with my `aAa` key earlier. Luckily it went away after less than an hour.

I worked on various projects today, such as creating Project Wikis for 5 projects, sorting projects and tabs, writing documentation, and creating a virtual mapping system for my life archive project.

I forgot to mention this, but recently (yesterday) our goat `Betty` had a baby. Luckily it wasn't a stillbirth this time. This baby is really cute (in my and everyone else in my households opinion) and it has been fun taking care of it. Today, the baby goat got to bask in the sunlight for the first time. It hasn't even been 48 hours yet, and the goat is already running and hopping around. I have gotten 2 videos of the goat today. I am really considering getting back on Vimeo to upload my videos for viewing somewhere.

Today was a good day for development.
