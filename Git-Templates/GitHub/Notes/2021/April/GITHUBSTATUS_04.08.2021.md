### Status update: April 8th 2021

I had a good day with development today. However, I have been really unfocused today, and my work has been all over the place. I broke my rule on caffeine addiction, as I desperately needed the boost today. I don't think it actually helped though, so I wasted a 3 month streak.

My laptops keyboard is getting worse again, and so is the battery. The `A` `S` `F` `FN` and `LEFT CTRL` keys have been having problems on and off today. I hope it is like March 2021, and these issues go away on their own. About my laptop battery, the capacity dropped another 6% today, and is now down to 77.8%, a 22.2% drop since July 9th 2020.

I started a new tradition of doing more forks of other projects today. It is helpful for note organization. I found that a few of my favorite old Minecraft mods are on GitHub, such as MrCrayfish's furniture mod, railcraft, and one I never installed but have seen lots of footage of: `tooMuchTNT`

I continued work on my degoogle campaign today, and made progress in modernizing some of the projects. I plan to do more updates tomorrow if I have time. I can't believe its Friday again already.

I am really working on going to bed earlier again today, so I quit earlier than last night. Tomorrow might be a difficult day if the addiction is bad again.

Today was a good day for development.
