### Status update: April 9th 2021

I had a pretty difficult day today. Last night, I got less than 7 hours of sleep, and I experimented with caffeine further, and have decided to permanently ban myself from drinking it due to bad reactions I had from it today and yesterday. This affected my day in both a positive and negative way. Mentally, it was negative, positively, I had more time, and got more done, but still didn't get everything I wanted to do done.

I got the normal work done with Git-image work, but had it even worse with my game addiction problem today. I have a last day of difficulty tomorrow before I have 5 days of normalcy.

I did further work on my degoogle-your-life campaign today, and left off 1 task (archiving 9 issues) due to little time.

On my own, I have been very social today.

Today was an OK day for development.
