### Status update: April 10th 2021

I had a very good day, but also a poor day in some ways. I was doing much better mentally today. I got a decent amount of work done today and made progress in current projects.

For image work, I came across more old, unuploaded content. I started uploading more of it today.

Today with personal time, pCloud completely failed, and no longer works for me on either my phone ot laptop. I tried Degoo, but it was still broken. I can't keep doing this, so I am just going to use an SD card instead.

I was going pretty fast with my work today, and received 2 GitHub `500 Internal Server error` errors in less than 4 hours, a new record.

I am still a little peeved about GitHub disabling the dark/light mode switch on my profile page, I have to keep an additional tab open again just to get the brightness right.

I hope to make improvements to work through the next 5 days. I don't know what else to say.

Today was an OK day for development.
