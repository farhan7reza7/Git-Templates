### Status update: April 11th 2021

I had a good day with work today, but my night didn't go well mentally.

Today, I learned another cool feature of markdown, which is the creation of checkboxes. The syntax for an unchecked box is `- [ ]` and the syntax for a checked box is `- [x]` pretty simple. The only con I can see to its usage is that you can't check/uncheck the box without modifying the file each time. I like this feature, and I am trying to find a way to use it.

I worked heavily on 2 political projects today, as I had ideas for them, and they needed to be finalized (for now)

Today was day 2 of the SD card transfer on my phone, I noticed that 2 files got corrupted in the process, but enough of their data remained that I feel like they can be repaired (unlike Windows, where the corrupted file will be 0 bytes in size every time) I feel like only a few lines were corrupted, and I feel these files are repairable. It isn't too much of a big deal, unless it gets worse, and the corruption ratio gets far worse than 2/1503 files being corrupted.
 
I got a lot of documentation work done today, along with the usual work. I hope to get something unique done tomorrow, but right now, I have to go to bed a little earlier (day 1, attempt ?/2021 of attempting to fix my schedule again) 

Today was an OK day for development.
