### Status update: April 12th 2021

I had a good day with work today, and my night went better.

Microsoft brought back the GitHub light/dark mode toggle on the profile page today, I like it better like this. Hopefully it will stay this time.

I did my usual work processes today, but missed out on cleaning. I am working on going to bed earlier and earlier to fix my schedule. An appointment today really threw me off.

Today during SD card transition, there were no corrupted imahge files today, although I have been noticing that each time I sort the batches that I copy off the SD card, the tracker-store daemon activates, and starts going between CPU cores and using 12.5*8% CPU for up to an hour.

I did brief Political work today, there was something in wanted to add.

My laptop had severe issues with the S and A keys today, these later were corrected. I don't know what keeps happening.

I fixed the tracker-miner-fs issue on my backup laptop today, and made a few edits from this device. I have enjoyed the 20000+ media files I can rediscover.

I am working on backing up my Reddit collection. I am even considering putting some of the content online early, although no NSFW content (gore, sexuality, etc.) will not be uploaded yet, along with 25+ megabyte files. It is a very sensitive set.

My laptop has been having battery issues related to the tracker daemon coming on over and over.

Last night, I accidenally forkbombed myself with a file I made in the past. It was a RAR file that contained 3 images (less than 4 MB) but it resulted in a 23+ gigabyte file, and bringiny my system down to 0 bytes of memory, so low that the file system menu refused to open, and I couldn't save empty files (testing)

Today was an OK day for development.
