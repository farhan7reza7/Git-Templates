### Status update: April 18th 2021

I had a good day with development today, but I didn't get everything I wanted to get done, completed.

I got a lot of experience with Linux today, learning several new terminal commands and tricks, and I installed Samba today. Unfortunately, due to 2 system crashes in less than 2 hours, where the mouse completely stopped working, I had to uninstall Samba. I received another crash about 6 and a half hours later which I assume was from VLC, as I only had VLC open for less than an hour, and it was open earlier as well. Unfortunately, this laptop is showing a lot of software problems of a past laptop. Luckily, my current main laptop is getting repaired tomorrow.

I spent a lot of time gaming today, but I also got some work done. Some projects I didn't get to today that I wanted to get to was improved support for the Inform IDE, starting the FLoC article, and optimizing my marine biology project, along with some project Wiki work. I will do this casually across the following week.

I was in a rush to finish tonight, but I took a break, as one of our goats gave birth to 2 children tonight, and I wanted to go out and see it and pause from my work.

I got a decent amount done today, and I finished doing documentation work later on.

I stayed up really late again tonight, but got nearly all my work done.

Today was a good day for development.
