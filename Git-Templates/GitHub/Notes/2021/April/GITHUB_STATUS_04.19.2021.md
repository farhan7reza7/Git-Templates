### Status update: April 19th 2021

I had a difficult day today. I got my laptop keyboard fixed on my main laptop, but due to my laptop not having a CMOS battery, the motherboard lost power and reverted the BIOs to default settings. I can't get it to boot past BusyBox. I was on call with Dell for over an hour today, and got to their 2 solutions of wiping the operating system and losing everything (which I won't do) or reach out to a 3rd party. I need help, and I am willing to pay cash for help (current offer is $40, the offer may go up)

When/if I start manufacturing computers and laptops in the future, I am going to make sure a CMOS battery or a fully functional tested alternate to it is present in every device I manufacture. 

I have joined ProtonTechnologies (the creators of ProtonMail, ProtonVPN, and more) today in supporting the people of Myanmar. I have now made Myanmar/Burmese a top priority when translating an article. I will keep this decision, even if the language were to go extinct. This is a permanent decision.

I finally got to one task I wanted to do yesterday today, which was working on the anti-Google FLoC article. I created a good article in good time, and started translating it. I did heavy amounts of translation to it. I added 2 new organization projects today, with only 1 being able to be made by me this month, due to a set limit of 10 per month.

I stayed up really late again tonight, but got nearly all my work done. I worked on trying to go to bed earlier

Today was a good day for development.
