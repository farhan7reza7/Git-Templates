### Status update: April 20th 2021

I was really tired last night and I didn't get to uploading my status post on time. I did that today.

Today was a pretty good day for development. I started 3 new research and documentation projects (although the GitHub Linguist hasn't picked up on the first 2 for some reason) but mainly today, I did translation work. I manually translated my Degoogle article into 50+ different languages, and set up importance of translations (which translations to do first)

Recently, I have noted that I have been working like I am not going to die tomorrow. So I have been trying to get important documentation tasks done as well to explain my projects better in a way that only I know.

I have had no luck in repairing the laptop, and my computer just nearly crashed at 11:21 pm, I saved it this time. VLC may be the problem, or it might be something else. I can't figure out what.

I got a follow-up with Mozilla today on my question/concern. Apparently, the theme does work, so I am going to have to add instructions on getting it to work.

I went to bed a little earlier tonight, and I was able to wrapup before midnight tonight. I could have done more today, but I needed the sleep.

I did work in various projects today. I did get a lot done, no matter what I falsely tell myself. It has been hard working without music lately though, as VLC crashes my laptop within 2 hours. 

Today was a great day for development.
