### Status update: April 22nd 2021

I had another good day with development today, this week has been pretty good. My schedule is starting to get out of control again though.

I discovered my old camera project today (CamCam+/CamCam++) and made extensive edits to its documentation. It hasn't been updated in over 5 months, and I got it up to date. I also spent over an hour doing translations, so it would rank higher in my commits and be another project type that is capable of being read in various languages all around the world.

I did work on various projects today. I started earlier on, as I got out of a meeting, and still had my laptop running on battery (not plugged in) it was still discharging, so I decided to use it and get some work done before starting my gaming sessions.

I made edits across various projects today, but was careful not to go to 25 different repositories today. I have a huge important personal event tomorrow at 1:00 pm that will last 1-2 hours, so I will have less time tomorrow, although I have been doing very well for the past 4 days, so that should make up for it. It might even cut off my Friday Egg Inc addiction, that and the excessive charge time of my phone.

I had to make an edit to my political repository today, as I re-read the sponsor rules on GitHub and had to check to make sure sponsorships weren't active on the project. In my head, I thought I laid out the rules pretty well that I didn't feel comfortable with that there, but I am glad I checked, as I was breaking ToS (Terms of Service) by having the button active. I have been avoiding committing to this repository, as it is not what I want to be known for, but I had to make 3 commits there to eradicate the sponsor button completely.

I added a very privacy-invasive project to GitHub today, but didn't develop it to a working point. I needed to get the idea out, and force public awareness that if you are to blur an image, you need to make it impossible to reverse. It is already pretty late to be doing this, but it has to be done, so that future info can be better protected. A good way to censor is to put opaque shapes over sensitive data, or pixelate it with very large DPI pixels.

Today was a great day for development.
