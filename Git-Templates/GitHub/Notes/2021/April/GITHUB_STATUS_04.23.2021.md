### Status update: April 23rd 2021

I had another very good day with development today. Again, this week has been a great week for development. I have been pushing really hard on my top 25 projects this month. My normal Friday addiction was cut short due to an important appointment, which I hope to try and do more often.

I had someone follow me today who claimed to be an EFF Member. I was pretty happy about it, but data from the next day shows they were likely just trying to harvest tons of followers, because their following (number of people they were following) dropped by over 600, and the EFF Member part was removed. They have since unfollowed me and haven't responded back.

I plan on working on my SVG video project, but the concept had to be partially rewritten overnight to take advantage of many features of SVG, and also to further difference between SVG Animation (it is not a fair comparison, it would be like comparing GIF to MP4. They are different formats that serve different purposes.

My computer remained relatively error free today, I still want to go back to my main laptop and keep this one as emergency backup. I didn't have time and also forgot to write a status file today, so I did so the next day.

Today was a great day for development.
