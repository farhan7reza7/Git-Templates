### Status update: April 24th 2021

I had another very good day with development today. It wasn't as good as the past 5 days though. My laptop had a significant number of errors today regarding the cursor freezing up, and I tried several things to fix it. So far, the working solution was to close the tab that had ~90 SVG video thumbnails (none of them were playing, but the laptop hasn't crashed in over 3 hours, so I assume this fixed it for now, I exhausted every other solution I could find)

I got back on top of status file and documentation work today, and also improved the SVG video format project. I did some work in other projects as well, but I mostly focused on the SVG_Video project today.

I quit slightly earlier tonight. I intend to work on my schedule again tonight.

Today was a great day for development.
