### Status update: April 25th 2021

I had another very good day with development today. This week has been really good.

I didn't work very much on the SVG video project today, but I worked in my usual projects, along with 1 new project regarding technical support of a digital cursor acting up. It will be a reference to myself and others. In this project, I made a joke that I ended up regretting when I went to share the project with my family, which was a criticism of the Windows 10 update process. I still stand by it, as it is still a major problem, and is one of the main reasons why I switched to Linux, and is my most easy to justify criticism of Windows 10 and switching to Linux (having control of your system is a good thing, I and many, many others have lost time and progress due to forced updates from Microsoft) I have partially corrected the joke, as it was meant to be serious documentation, but it will take time to purge it from the main translation README file at root, and all the other translations.

Today is my 11 month anniversary of GitHub usage. In 1 month, I will be a GitHub user for 1 year.

Today was a great day for development.
