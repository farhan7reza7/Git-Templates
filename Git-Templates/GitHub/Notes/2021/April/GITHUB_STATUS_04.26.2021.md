### Status update: April 26th 2021

I had a difficult day today. I got some work done, but I didn't do very well. There were a lot of factors, but the main one was likely getting less than 6 hours of sleep, as the past 3 times I went with less than 8 hours of sleep, I haven't done well.

Today, I finalized and began publishing a new concept that I have been developing and deciding on for 2 months, which begins the Skeuwie (or Skeuowie) desktop environment, the UNIX environment with a sole focus on skeuomorphism (the environment is heavily inspired by KDE, but I am going in a different approach design and functionality wise)

I discovered GitHub skyline today, and I find it pretty cool. I would experiment with it and have my 2020 skyline as a trophy, but unfortunately, my familys 3D printer has been out of service for quite some time (at least 6 months) and it might be a waste of filament, but I feel that it would be a good trophy as a first year of GitHub.

My laptops battery has had unusually poor performance today. I hope I can resolve the issue soon.

I did GitHub work during my Khan Academy session and continued to listen, as I have already gone in-depth with this current subject in 10th grade biology class.

Today was an OK day for development.
