### Status update: April 27th 2021

I got a lot done again today, but still slightly less than what I wanted to do.

I took a couple hours out of my time to update my cursor tech support article and update and add many translations.

India has been having a nightmare lately. They recently reached 500 million COVID-19 cases, and they are experiencing a spike of cases over 10x of that of their May 2020 outbreak. I feel horrible about this, and I am doing what I can to make the lives of the people in India easier. There are so many beautiful cultures in India that I don't want to die out. Similar to the Myanmar situation, I have made India a foreign aid program member, and I am now prioritizing various Indian language translations for projects (such as Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and many more)

I have really come to dislike Firefox 89. From the beta, the Proton tab system is heavily flawed, and Firefox is losing more and more user control. Even Firefox 88 has some problems, due to some things getting moved around and renaming (like the close tab button being moved up 2 spaces on the dropdown menu. or `customize` being translated to `customize toolbar` which confused me at first, as I wasn't trying to modify the toolbar) I have 3 backups lined up for if it gets worse (Tor with ProtonVPN, Konquerer, or Waterfox)

I worked on various projects today. I am dreading next Tuesday, due to my Idle Miner Tycoon session being a possible setback and addiction on that day.

I did some development on WacOS today, it is my top programming project. I didn't do much to it today, mostly documentation changes.

I have continued to procrastinate on the development of the SVG video and Skeuowie projects, along with LinkLax.

I have come up with an idea, where projects with generic titles will become templates, and will be used to create a life archive extra. Also, a planned commit description change that I hope to keep and not forget is to say `for this directory set` when referring to a root file clone in a folder. It is late at night, I don't know how to simplify this. I hope to continue this change and not forget.

Today was a very good day for development.
