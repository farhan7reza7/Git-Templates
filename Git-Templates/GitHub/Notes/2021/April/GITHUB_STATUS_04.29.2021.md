### Status update: April 28th 2021

I had a very good day today. I completed the rest of my non-consecutive monthly goals (other than image projects) and I got a lot done today in various projects.

One of my big goals was recently completed, which was increased software library support in SNU Translate. I made a lot of progress with this today.

GitHub had a weird error today and signed me out. It was the only error that occurred today.

I have been waiting for May for the past 9 days. I really want to see my month in review, and get closer to my 1 year anniversary, and have a clean slate of progress.

I got my work done much earlier today, and stopped working by 9:00 pm. I have an early doctors appointment tomorrow morning, and I need to get my schedule under control again. I have really been failing on this lately.

I have done my research, and the problem I have with Firefox performance has not been fixed at all. CPU usage may be down with Firefox Quantum, but I have come across various posts from people with my exact issue (Firefox using more and more RAM overtime) from my research, it has been a problem since at least Firefox 3.6.x and continued, even into the Quantum era. CPU usage has been generally bad today when playing videos, jumping 40% during my Khan Academy work. I hate doing this, but I am going to have to switch to another non-Chromium browser. It sucks, as I have been using Firefox for most of my life when browsing the Internet (although I did use Internet Explorer 6 in my early years of Elementary School, and I was on and off Google Chrome from 2009 to 2018. I just don't like what Mozilla is doing, and I need a better browser. I am still trying to decide between Tor, Waterfox, and Konquerer.

I did another torrent today, my 2nd largest one since the entirety of the English Wikipedia, and other Wikimedia subprojects in English (surprisingly, all of that is only 190 gigabytes) todays torrent was over 29 gigabytes. I have now noted that archive.org isn't completely safe, as it is still peering to other people on large files, but I decided to take the risk today.

I have learned why I have been having difficulty writing scripts lately (subject "scripts" for "code" if the terminology is incorrect, I really just hate the word "code" and "coding" and prefer "program" "programming" "software engineering" "script" and "scripting" instead) which is that the reason I stop myself is because I start writing boilerplate code, which is pretty pointless to have everything in. This is why I stopped myself on work on some projects (such as SVG Video) until I find new methods of programming.

Today was a good day for development.
