### Status update: April 30th 2021

I had a very good day with development today. Today is the last day of April 2021, and I have a clean slate of progress tomorrow.

This morning, I had a doctors appointment, it didn't go too well (in my opinion yesterday, but today, I realize it was important) and I got another vaccine (not a COVID-19 one, as I already had both of them earlier this year) I am now fully up-to-date on my vaccinations (including COVID-19 vaccination)

I did less GitHub work today. I also didn't have the time to write a daily status post, as I got too tired. I did more torrenting today, but one got stuck, so I just went and downloaded from archive.org, as the site appears to be functional now (it was failing 4 megabytes in on downloads the last time I tried to download directly) I did a lot of work today, and was in a really good mood again today.

My laptop hasn't been doing too well. I recently fully uninstalled Samba, but it is still having severe battery drain issues, along with random freeze-ups (as of May 1st 2021, I have noted that waiting 1 minute or pressing the shift key will resolve the freeze-up issue)

Today was a good day for development.
