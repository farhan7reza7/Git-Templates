# Idle Miner Tycoon session April 6th 2021

<!-- I had a shorter Idle Miner session today in preparation of my monthly Idle Miner Tycoon session. I made some progress today, and decided to quit early.

Change of plans: I got addicted and played late. Once a month, good. !-->

I had my monthly Idle Miner Tycoon session today. I originally thought I would be able to quit by 3:00 pm, but the session dragged on until 4:59 pm. Luckily, this is a once-a-month thing.

When making the first archived zip file, WinRAR ran into an error (I would use 7zip, but this Android, it doesn't have it, and WinRAR is the best I can go on Android) and I had to re-zip the file.

Today, I did gameplay on all mines across all continents (that I have unlocked)

## Start continent

I made progress on the start continent today, and made progress on all the mines. A good strategy is to take money from 1 mine that produces more than another, spend it on the smaller mine, and get a huge boost. I also like to try to maintain a level number of shafts, warehouses, and elevators that is equally divisible by 10. This is pretty hard to pull off.

I went back to the gold mine in the end, as it is my favorite start continent mine, and I wanted to start next months session there.

I also maxed out my ad timer on the start continent. I would do the same for the ice continent, but until I can unlock the jade mine, I can't, as I would have to deal with 4x as many ads to max out each individual mine, rather than the entire continent.

## Mainland

I made 5 new maxed out mineshafts on the mainland gem mine today, and made progress for the next session. It is going to take much more time to level up gem mines now due to the monthly session.

## Ice continent

Just as I thought I was going to be able to quit early, I got even more addicted to gameplay on the ice continent. Gameplay lasted well over an hour here, I did prestige on the sapphire mine, and made progress on my 4 ice continent mines.

## Research

I started using research points actively today, and unlocked + upgraded several boosts.

## Game issues

In the beginning, I went to customize and the game completely froze up. Upon closing and reloading thrice (3 times) it still hung and couldn't fully load the game. I assume it got stuck on a data packet regarding trying to customize. A device restart fixed the issue, and it didn't reoccur, and I decided not to experiment with that button.

## Session length

As expected, the session dragged on for a very long time (over 4 hours) which is the reason why I limited my gameplay of this game to once a month. It was still enjoyable.
