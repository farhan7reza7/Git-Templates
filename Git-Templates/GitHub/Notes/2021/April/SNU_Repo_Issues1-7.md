Can't upload URL files #2 

### Can't upload URL files

I didn't upload some `.URL` files, due to how difficult it is to open or upload them on a Windows platform. I will try again on Linux, maybe it is different there, as I am not sure if Linux recognizes `.URL` files by default, or if it handles them the same way.

r1:

Yes, it is completely different on Linux. I can upload URL files on Linux with absolutely no issue, and I have fixed this issue on July 18th 2020 at 3:27 pm. This issue is now closed.

Java packages can't be uploaded #3 

### Java packages can't be uploaded

The following 3 files couldn't be uploaded due to size and copyright reasons:

> `eclipse-inst-win64 .exe`

> `jdk-8u181-windows-x64.exe`

> `jre-8u181-windows-x64.exe`

Find them, or an alternate to them on your own.

Need help ripping the new Google sites #5 

# Need help ripping the new Google sites

I need help ripping the "new" Google sites. The earliest forms of SNU are within my old Google site, and there is no way so far that I have found to successfully rip the entire site. It is part of my own account, yet it can't be downloaded via Google takeout, which is a clear violation of certain international laws. The methods I have tried are:

> * Google takeout - The download option doesn't exist, only the old Google sites option does

> * Using HTTrack - This rips all the files, but opening any of them will just redirect to the main page, plus a lot of data is missing as well.

If you know any ways of ripping this website, please let me know. I will award you with free intermediate technical support for a month, along with some other rewards if I can get an answer.

Most SNU2 Trends videos can't be uploaded #7 

***

### Most SNU2 Trends videos can't be uploaded

I couldn't upload most of the SNU 2 trend videos due to the GitHub 25 megabyte file upload limit, and copyright. I only uploaded 2 Ubuntu based videos, as it is public domain content. The other videos can't be uploaded.

I can't fix this, unless the limit is raised, and/or the copyright expires.
