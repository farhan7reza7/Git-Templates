I started using Ecosia more heavily again today, I unfortunately stopped using it for a while. Today, I did research and found that it takes about 8.8 (9) trees to make up for 1 gallon of gasoline being used daily, if each tree were to take out 1 kilogram of carbon. The number is pretty saddening, and since I can't plant any trees at my house at the moment, I decided to emphasize Ecosia again, and try to plant at least 900 trees to make up for all the gasoline my close family has used. This will take a while, as that is about 900x45 (40500) searches, but I am hoping that I can spread the popularity and message of Ecosia to speed this up.
