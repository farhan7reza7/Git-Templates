### Status

#### Main

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

<!-- I performed poorly today production wise, as I had very little time. The trip home took over 8 hours due to delays, and I got a lot less time to work. Today was good development wise for the small amount of time I had.

I have held off image work for now, I will resume on Sunday or Monday. I was going to do work during the car ride, but I wasn't able to focus.
!-->

I had a very good day with development again today, I got back into GitHub pages creation, and worked more on my pirate video game today. I got to everything today that I wasn't able to do in the past 2 days, meaning I did 3 days worth of work in 1 day today.

### Apple iCloud August 2021 controversy

**THIS SECTION IS OUTDATED**

Today, I learned of something stupid Apple did. They are now scanning all iCloud media for child abuse content. Now you are probably asking, how is that bad? Don‚Äôt you hate child abuse? Yes I do, but there is a massive flaw with this: algorithms aren‚Äôt that good yet. When I was using OneDrive, it had such poor recognition of everyday objects that it was incredibly laughable. Applying this filter is like using Google Translate to pass a PhD College exam in Esperanto, It isn‚Äôt accurate enough. I think that Apple should still try this, but they shouldn‚Äôt pull a Google/YouTube and leave everything to the machine, there needs to be people checking the incidents of child abuse to make sure it isn‚Äôt someone doing something innocent like recording videos of a fish that the algorithm may think is of someone dropkicking a child down the stairs, as the algorithm really can be that bad. Imagine taking a picture of a burrito and uploading it to iCloud, then having the FBI come and arrest you and take away your children, because the algorithm was that bad. Algorithms are easily fooled. YouTube is a very primary example of this.

The problem: leaving it to the machines

The solution: have a real person or a team of people (if a single person can't be trusted) verify each claim of child abuse to make sure the algorithm isn't sending an innocent person to prison

**DETADTUO SI NOITCES SIHT**

I am keeping this section until I can document it better, the situation is worse than expected. I wasn't aware enough of this, and I know that this is a bad thing, and that Apple is falling on its small privacy platform, which was never really very legitimate due to the majority of Apple software being proprietary. This is yet another example of the "Think of the Children" argument, where emotions are evoked as children are used as scapegoats, so that Apple can take away user freedom without much setback. This strategy has unfortunately worked many times ever since the September 11th 2001 attacks, but luckily, society seems to be figuring this out, as it wasn't received well by the privacy community and people outside of the privacy community. Facebook even had the audacity to make an announcement that they oppose this, while good, they are in absolutely no position to say anything, and they are trying to look like the good guys by taking advantage of a weakened Apple.

### Ecosia

I started using Ecosia more heavily again today, I unfortunately stopped using it for a while. Today, I did research and found that it takes about 8.8 (9) trees to make up for 1 gallon of gasoline being used daily, if each tree were to take out 1 kilogram of carbon. The number is pretty saddening, and since I can't plant any trees at my house at the moment, I decided to emphasize Ecosia again, and try to plant at least 900 trees to make up for all the gasoline my close family has used. This will take a while, as that is about 900x45 (40500) searches, but I am hoping that I can spread the popularity and message of Ecosia to speed this up.

I used Ecosia again today. - August 5th 2021

I unfortunately didn't use Ecosia today. - August 6th to August 10th 2021

### Lowering my expectations

My mind recently messed up a little bit when I failed to work on 25 different repositories for 3 days in a row, and also getting 200 commits. These expectations are being removed, and being replaced with a "whatver I can do comfortably" amount. This was an issue on July 16th 2021, but as of July 20th 2021, I have recovered.

#### Laptop mouse issues arise again (started June 24th 2021)

Still no reoccurence - July 8th 2021 at 7:31:09 pm

There were some minor mouse issues upon shutdown last night, but it might have been due to the system going very slow at the time for some reason - July 9th 2021

Still no recourrence today. - July 10th 2021

Still no recourrence today. - July 11th 2021

A possible reoccurence today, the mouse didn't freeze entirely, but it lagged several times. - July 12th 2021

Dragging files was increasingly difficult at one point, stopping the process of letting me drag files before it could escape the window, I felt like it was a bug with GNOME files/Nautilus. I remember my unstable XPS-13 doing this, it is similar to a cursor bug, but it wasn't a cursor freezing bug. - July 13th 2021

No issues today - July 14th 2021

No issues today... yet - July 15th 2021

The issue reoccurred today. The caps lock light got stuck on, and also required 2 presses for CAPS LOCK and 1 press for caps lock, and 4 minutes later, the mouse crashed. I was already upset by the caps lock button that the mouse issue felt normal, as they seemed to be connected. My heart didn't even race, but I hope it does not reoccur. It simply took typing `gnome-extensions` to fix it. - July 16th 2021

It was fine today. - July 17th 2021

It was fine again today. - July 18th 2021

No issues with this again today. - July 19th 2021

My cursor has been acting a bit weird tonight, but it hasn't crashed yet (as of 11:13 pm) - July 20th 2021

The cursor was a bit finnicky today, but overall, it was fine and didn't crash (as of 11:52 pm) - July 21st 2021

Everything was fine cursor wise today (As of Thursday, July 22nd 2021 at 11:59:59:9999) - July 22nd 2021

Everything is fine so far (as of Friday, July 23rd 2021 at 12:08 am) No new data, everything is fine. :-} - July 23rd 2021

No reoccurence today, although my keyboard has been acting up today, along with my touchpad (briefly) - July 23rd 2021

No reoccurence today, everything is fine. - July 24th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything is fine still. - July 25th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything is fine still. - July 27th 2021 to August 2nd 2021

No reoccurence today, although XORG crashed and brought my system down at 22:45:17 - August 3rd 2021

No reoccurence today, everything was perfect today. - August 5th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything was perfect again today. - August 6th 2021

The caps lock key went out, and it was acting weird beforehand. I knew exactly where this was going, so I saved everything and restarted. I am not sure if this counts as a crash. Other than this, everything was fine today. - August 7th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything was perfect today. - August 8th 2021

#### Tribute to Dennis Ritchie

I did not work on the Tribute project to Dennis Ritchie today. Updates are waiting for his posthumous birthday on September 9th (the next occurence being September 9th 2021, in `46` days from today (This section was last updated on July 24th 2021)

##### Computer crash

_Crashes before June 18th 2021 are not listed here._

**As part of a cleanup process on this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

I thought the Wi-Fi symbol just became glitched, but it wasn't an error, our Internet just failed, the whole city won't have Internet until about 8 pm, so I will have to work offline for 3 hours. So much for Spectrums "99.9% reliability" this isn't even the first time this year that the Internet has gone out here. No other problems today. - July 4th 2021

There was a small 6 second freeze today, but that was it - July 5th 2021

There were no new crashes today. I decided to reinstall GIMP so I could do some graphic design work. I am yet to see if this is going to cause problems. There was another small 6 second freeze today, but that was it. I am wondering if having music playing helps prevent the lag from crashing the system. It is better than Windows at least, because if it crashes, it is a bit more calm and will continue to play music up until the screen goes black, rather than scaring the s##t out of me when it starts loudly buzzing and flickering, and then crashing. - July 6th 2021

No technical issues today - July 7th 2021

It was a bit difficult mounting my SD card today, but the recent issue with Dongles has been resolved, as my hard drive was recognized, just not the SD card. I also successfully did a hard drive backup today. - July 8th 2021

Everything IO wise is fine right now, and there was no instability today. - July 9th 2021

There was some slowness last night, the cursor lagged a bit and made my heart race, but it quickly came back within 1.3 seconds. The whole system was going slow, and I was shutting down. Additionally, it got stuck at a black screen for over 20 seconds during the shutdown process before turning off, which really worried me. - July 9th 2021

The SD card is still slightly difficult to mount, but everything else is fine IO wise. The system is still stable, as of 9:28 pm. - July 10th 2021

The SD card was perfect today, everything was fine IO wise, and there was no instability today. I recently got a new USB C to USB C cord, but I messed up on something, and I wasn't able to charge my laptop through a portable battery like I wanted. My laptop doesn't recognize it in the 8 different ways I plugged it in. It will still be a useful piece of equipment to have. - July 11th 2021

The SD card was nearly perfect today, everything was fine IO wise, and there was some slight instability. - July 12th 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, everything else was fine IO wise, there was a minor cursor issue today (see above) and there were no other issues today. - July 13th 2021

There was no instability today, unless you count IO issues, of which the SD card is still being difficult. - July 14th 2021

The SD card was incredibly unstable today, and took nearly 100 unmounts/remounts + 1 system restart to eventually detect. I don't know how much longer I can sustain this. Unfortunately, USB is not an option for everyday use. Also earlier today, my keyboard light kept dimming 5x faster than it normally does. It isn't too big of a deal, so I just turned it off. I hope it doesn't mean there will be further keyboard issues. I also tested it again at 10:29 pm, it is fine again. That is all that happened today with difficulties in computing. - July 15th 2021

The SD card finally mounted at the same time I got an recommended updates notification. The SD card wasn't nearly as bad as yesterday. My system felt a bit clunky today. The mouse cursor issue reoccurred today. 4 minutes prior, another issue started up. The caps lock light got stuck on, and also required 2 presses for CAPS LOCK and 1 press for caps lock, and 4 minutes later, the mouse crashed. I was already upset by the caps lock button that the mouse issue felt normal, as they seemed to be connected. My heart didn't even race, but I hope it does not reoccur. - July 16th 2021

The SD card was a real pain today, but it still works. My keyboard was a bit dirty earlier, and all the keys were having problems. After lots of crunching, it is fixed. - July 17th 2021

The SD card was very difficult today, but I got it to work. I also messed up and didn't have all the files handy the first time, so I had to do it twice. Luckily, it was far less difficult the second time. Other than that, there were no other technical issues today. - July 18th 2021

The only problem today was IO functionality, which I have still not found a root cause to. - July 19th 2021

The SD card wasn't too difficult today. It still is a problem. There was also some sporadic cursor movements at time while writing this status file tonight. - July 20th 2021

The SD card was very, very difficult today, taking hundreds of ummounts, running this command:

```shell
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/rescan
```

doing a system restart, and dealing with over 42 minutes of IO errors before I could access the SD card. The laptop was also acting a bit finnicky at times today, and had 2 internal errors due to `tracker-miner-fs` breaking as usual, as I decided not to kill it early on (it has always been broken for me, and uses up over 1 GiB of RAM and 30 MiB of SWAP when not killed, alongside 20-90% overall CPU usage (combined across 8 CPU cores) for 30 minutes to 6 hours. If you are having a similar problem, here is what I have to type into the terminal daily to fix it:

```shell
tracker reset --hard
```

Don't be afraid to run it. I have ran it on 3 different installations of Ubuntu across the past year and nearly 1 month a few hundreds times and have not received any damaged data from it.

Other than that, it was fine. - July 21st 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, but not nearly as bad as yesterday. No sore thumbs. Judging by my data for the past 10 days, it is only going to get worse tomorrow. This is not a 100% there is still hope that it won't be difficult. - July 22nd 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, but it was hardly a problem. It was easier than yesterday, so it broke my data pattern. - July 23rd 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, but it was hardly a problem. It was actually easier than yesterday, so it broke my data pattern again. - July 24th 2021

The GNOME shell restarted today due to too frequent file saving. It was a user error, nothing was lost, and it was fine. Also, my SD card has been getting easier and easier to mount. Lately, it has taken dozens to hundreds of attempts, and in the past 3 days, it has gotten increasingly easier to mount. Today, I got it on the 3rd try. - July 25th 2021

There were a couple small system freezes today that lasted 6 seconds each, but none of them resulted in a crash. The SD card was very easy today, working on the first mount. I finally figured out the technique of putting it in to the exact nanometer for it to work properly. No other issues today. - July 26th 2021

There were no technical difficulties today. - July 27th 2021

There were a few program crashes today (nautilus, and a self-inflicted mutter crash by typing `mutter` into Konsole, as I recently found that this causes `Mutter` to have a segmentation fault and perform a core dump. Afterwards, my volume sound effects weren't working until nautilus crashed a second time, although audio still played before and after all crashes) the SD card was again fine today, and there were no other issues. - July 28th 2021

There were some program crashes again today, it was nautilus (GNOME files) again. Other than that, everything was fine. The SD card is also still performing nearly perfectly. - July 29th 2021

There was no instability today, and the SD card performed decently again. - July 30th 2021

There was 1 near crash today, and the SD card performed slightly worse today. - July 31st 2021

There was no instability today, the SD card performed slightly better today. - August 1st 2021

There was no instability today, the SD card performed worse today, mounting itself quickly, but constantly randomly unmounting itself, even during the copy process. - August 2nd 2021

There was minor instability today, with an XORG crash bringing my system down at 22:45:17 (10:45 pm) and continued issues with the SD card unmounting itself, and also taking a long time to connect. - August 3rd 2021

There was no instability today. The SD card didn't randomly unmount, it is just back to taking a long time to detect. - August 4th 2021

Functionality was 100% perfect today, no crashes, no lag, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I hope it is the same tomorrow. - August 5th 2021

Functionality was 100% perfect again today, no crashes, no lag, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I hope it is the same again tomorrow. - August 6th 2021

Functionality was nearly perfect again today, there was 1 possible crash (I restarted before it could crash, so I don't know if that counts) some lag before the possible crash, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I am going to stop mentioning the SD card until it becomes a problem again. - August 7th 2021

Functionality was 100% perfect again today, no crashes, no lag, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I hope it is the same again tomorrow. - August 8th 2021

The SD card had some minor difficulties today, but other than that, everything was perfect today. - August 9th 2021 to August 10th 2021

#### Windows 11

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries from June 16th 2021 to June 23rd 2021 have been removed. You can find them in older entries.**

Windows 11 released: **June 24th 2021**

My opinion on Windows 11 has shifted significantly based on the announcement, with a growing negative attitude towards it. My new concerns are:

1. The system requiring 4 gigabytes of RAM (not including applications)

2. The system requiring ~64 gigabytes of storage

3. The system requiring an Internet connection and Microsoft Account to install

4. No 32 bit support (this may be a problem for older computers as well, but we should already be moved on from 32 bit at this point, it has been 27 years since the first 64 bit general consumer system came out (Nintendo 64) and the first consumer Windows 64 bit desktop came out in 2005, so I don't consider this too bad)

I am negative towards all these, especially the 3rd entry. I feel like Windows 11 is getting far too bloated and the Internet requirement to install is really stupid, and may not be possible in countries where Internet connection is not good enough to download gigabytes of data. It also will make it much more difficult to get a Windows 11 virtual machine, which is needed for people who can't have a Windows device, similar to the problem where developers have to buy a Macbook to develop for Apple, you can't buy every single device to develop, it will make it too difficult. There was a reason why this was already so opposed on Windows 10. This might be a failing point for the system, Microsoft, you should take note in this, more people should point this out to them, as my voice alone is too small. Another thing I find ridiculous is the 4 gigabytes of RAM to run the operating system. Not everyone has a super powerful computer, I know people who only have 2 or less gigabytes of RAM and will not be able to get this, I have also had to warn everyone in my house about performance problems, as the Windows 10 devices in this house only have 4-6 gigabytes of RAM and already run the operating system very poorly, and will not be able to handle the update. Even with Linux, with over 8x less RAM usage than Windows 11 (with Ubuntu + GNOME, the most bloated Linux combination; I could get usage down to 256/512 megabytes if/when I switch to a lighter stack) I am struggling to run applications, even with 8 gigabytes of RAM. I don't see this going very well.

Finally, the storage requirement. Storage is getting cheaper, but this is still ridiculous for an operating system. When you compare Windows XP and Windows 11, it is obvious that bloat has gotten bad at warp speed (64 megabytes vs 4096 megabytes (RAM) 1.5 gigabytes vs 64 gigabytes (Storage, with some models requiring at least 1 terabyte of storage for some reason) 133 megahertz (1 core) vs 1 Gigahertz (2 cores) (CPU speed) 32 bit support vs no 32 bit support (CPU type)) - June 24th 2021

I forgot to mention this, but Windows 11 is still in beta, so some things can be changed. I don't have much hope in the RAM, CPU, or Storage usage problems being fixed, but I feel like if enough people bug, the issues with the Trusted Protections Module DRM problem and Internet connected install/Microsoft account issues can be fixed. - June 25th 2021

My thoughts remain the same, no new data - June 26th 2021

No new thoughts, no new data - June 27th 2021

None - June 28th 2021

For the people who still use Windows and did not like Cortana, I have good news for you! Cortana is not included by default. I didn't have much against Cortana, I never developed an opinion on it, I just know that a lot of people couldn't stand her compared to other voice assistants. - June 29th 2021

I found out that Internet Explorer is officially discontinued now, which is good news for web developers. I will still be developing support for Internet Explorer via the BrowserNose project (quick summary: the BrowserNose project is a library that emulates support for every version of every web browser with as little feature loss as possible, all the way down to WorldWideWeb/Nexus (the first web browser) ) - June 29th 2021

This security thing TPM 2.0 is really sticking, I feel less hopeful about it being changed. Something I also forgot to mention was the removal of legacy BIOs support in favor of UEFI. I don't know enough about this to comment, other than it being another thing that prevents older computers from using Windows 11. - June 29th 2021

No new data, no new thoughts - June 30th 2021

No new thoughts, I did get to one of my extra goals today - July 1st 2021

My opinion towards the GUI is changing from negative to positive, I feel like Fluent Design is not the worst possible thing, and is a step towards skeuomorphism, which would be great, as minimalism sucks. I can actually tell this system apart from other systems now, unlike tens of thousands of releases of various operating systems and desktop environments from 2011 onward. Seriously, iOS 7 and up and Android 7 and up are pretty much identical in so many ways that I can hardly tell them apart. What is the point in designing a system if it isn't unique or different from the rest? Go and change the default wallpaper, and it is almost impossible to tell them apart, other than extremely small differences. - July 2nd 2021

No new data - July 3rd 2021 to July 4th 2021

Forcing users to get a 5 gigabyte OneDrive account isn't the best idea. Memory is really cheap nowadays, even in the expensive Solid State Drive format, I can get a terabyte of storage for $300 even with expensive solid state, which is 200x more storage more than a OneDrive account. I could get a 10 terabyte external hard drive for less than $250 and have over 2000 tkmes more space than having OneDrive and every one of its account offers. Cloud storage isn't for everyone. Has anyone seen the videos I am referencing, where OneDrive immediately re-opens when you close it - July 5th 2021

No new thoughts, no new data - July 6th 2021 to July 16th 2021

The Trusted Platforms Module DRM seems to be illegal for Russian and Chinese Windows users. This is a good thing. I wish DRM was illegal everywhere though. - July 17th 2021

I am extremely disappointed in the fact that Windows 11 home isn't as much of an operating system as it is a web service. If you have to use the Internet to install a 64 gigabyte operating system, completely dependant on that connection, with no offline disk image installation available, do you really own your computer? Absolutely not. It is depressing. - July 18th 2021

I looked into this further, all 32 bit support is removed on Windows 11, not just for the processor itself, but for any 32 bit sofware. I am really glad I finally switched to Linux over a year ago, as I remember my games I had were 32 bit only. Things like this make me regret it less and less each day, there wasn't much to regret anyways. Although, it is time for the industry to move to x64 or x64_128, so this is actually a positive thing. It is still sad to see it go. - July 19th 2021

No new thoughts, no new data - July 20th 2021 to July 26th 2021

Microsoft actually listened to the community and removed the TPM 2.0 DRM cipher requirement. It is still over-specked (likely not a word, but you know what I mean) and not open source enough. 

No new thoughts, no new data - July 28th 2021 to August 10th 2021

**Extras:**

1. Update `SeansLifeArchive_Extras_OtherWindows` further when ready.

2. Update the original Windows NT image repo with more Windows 8 pictures when ready.

3. New BSoD and RSoD images and documentation available and ready to use, starting July 21st 2021

4. No other extras at the moment

##### IDE work

I did not create any new IDE projects today. - July 5th 2021

I continued work on the revival of the TalkScript project today, the project went stale for 12 months before I made a breakthrough and was able to continue its development. This was the only IDE work I did today, it wasn't the normal IDE work. - July 6th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects today - July 7th 2021 to July 15th 2021

I did a little bit of IDE work today, starting the foundation for the SNU Programming Tools Batchfile, Pug, and KiXtart IDE sets. - July 16th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 17th 2021 to July 18th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 19th 2021 <!-- The repository SafeT doesn't count, as it is not an IDE !-->

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 20th 2021 <!-- Again, the repository SafeT doesn't count, as it is not an IDE !-->

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 21st 2021 to August 9th 2021

##### GitHub pages

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

Today is day 13 of my usage of GitHub pages. The Internet went out during my prime time today, so I had to work offline. I made progress later on, finishing up 1 page, and beginning work on another. - July 4th 2021

Today is day 14 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did brief work today and started 2 new pages, but got burnt out for the night out of stress of an error I made recently regarding 3 snap packages being for the wrong environment (I needed to do /bots instead of /robotics) - July 5th 2021

Today is day 15 of my usage of GitHub pages. I created new pages today, but I am growing very tired of having to refresh the page and wait 3-28+ times just to switch to an organization to create a new page. - July 6th 2021

Today is day 16 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but didn't achieve all my goals. I am growing extremely tired of having to refresh the page and wait 3-28+ times just to switch to an organization to create a new page. It was at its worst today. I did some inspecting and found that in the background, GitHub is constantly returning a 502 error and is failing to load the last few kilobytes of the data packets required to display the organization list. I don't know how to fix this, this might be something only Microsoft can fix. I wasted over an hour with this issue today. - July 7th 2021

Today is day 17 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but didn't achieve all my goals. I still got a decent amount done, writing README files for over 2 hours. I had very little issue with creating new pages today, although I only created 1, so it doesn't count against yesterdays issue. - July 8th 2021

Today is day 18 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but reached a limit and couldn't do more work. I also ran low on time. GitHub was not difficult with me with changing users today, so it worked out fine. I created 3 new pages today, and worked on several. - July 9th 2021

Today is day 19 of my usage of GitHub pages. This was my main focus for most of the day today, and I did incredibly well. I didn't reach the 25 project limit, but I created 5 new pages, and worked on some other ones as well. - July 10th 2021

Today is day 20 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't do any work here today, as I was focusing on documenting snapcraft usage. - July 11th 2021

Today is day 21 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't do any work here today, as I was focusing on documenting snapcraft usage. - July 12th 2021

Today is day 22 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made minor progress today, working on 2 new sites, and completing a couple of them. Despite having so much time today, I wasn't able to do as much as I should have been able to do. - July 13th 2021

Today is day 23 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made minor progress again today, working on 2 new sites, and completing one of them. Despite having so much time today, I wasn't able to do as much as I should have been able to do. I am nearing 10% completion with the webpage creation process. - July 14th 2021

Today is day 24 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made good progress today, creating and finishing 3 new sites, and also finishing another one (4 in total) it is becoming a very easy process. I have the documentation methods nailed at this point. - July 15th 2021

Today is day 25 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not use GitHub pages today. I worked on other projects. Apparently, stuff I create on my organizations is included in my main repository counter, so today, I ended up exceeding 1,100 projects. - July 16th

Today is day 26 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not make any new pages or work on any, but I made some useful templates for future work. - July 17th 2021

Today is day 27 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not make any new pages or work on any today. - July 18th 2021

Today is day 28 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not make any new pages or work on any today. I am starting to grow disappointed in my lack of doing so. - July 19th 2021

Today is day 29 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made a significant comeback today, working on 7 different pages, creating 5 new pages, and finishing 4 pages. I found an effective strategy for creating pages that bypasses the account switching part of the work:

```
Effective page creating strategy:

Go to /github/seanpm2001/organizations
Visit the preferred organization
Make sure the template you want to use is forked there
Create a new repository via the organizations repo create button
Absolutely no delays, just start creating
```

I am still a bit disappointed in myself for not finishing the other 3 pages today. - July 20th 2021

Today is day 30 (exactly 1 month to date) of my usage of GitHub pages. I made minor progress today, finishing the 3 pages I didn't get to yesterday, and working on 4 snap projects to match the 7 pages I have worked on recently (3 pages didn't require a snap package) I might not be able to make progress tomorrow due to so many of my repository work slots being full. - July 21st 2021

Today is day 31 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't create any new pages or work on any, but I did create the improved V5 General template for GitHub pages useless, so you can't say I did nothing. - July 22nd 2021

Today is day 32 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't do any GitHub pages or GitHub pages related work today. - July 23rd 2021

Today is day 33 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did some brief GitHub pages work today, creating and finishing 1 new site for the Team8Collection project. - July 24th 2021

Date of start: June 21st 2021 (day 1) to: August 10th 2021 (day 50)

##### Organization work continued

No data available

#### Snapcraft

I have recently started to work on porting my projects to Snapcraft, as an extra install option. Really, the only problem with snapcraft is that the server end is proprietary, the rest of the format is open source. I am still very new to this, and I have no way to actually develop snap programs. I have just been filling out the applications for it.

As part of fearing the rising problem of software as a service, I am going to stop supporting snapcraft at the current degree. I am also going to lessen my support for services, and promote ownership of products. I am also going to start fighting planned obsolescence harder, as it is a real problem environmentally, and societally.

[Gizmodo link](https://gizmodo.com/in-2030-you-wont-own-any-gadgets-1847176540) I have other research to support this issue, but there are too many to list here. I will list the full problem below.

#### Phases of the year (2020)

<!-- This section is incomplete. !-->

For my first year of GitHub, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml
January: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
February: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
March: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
April: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
May: the start of seanpm2001/Joining GitHub
June: the very basics of Git, SNU replatforming
July: Getting comfortable with Git and GitHub, July 9th, dawn of the Linux era
August: The rise of git-image, commits en masse.
September: The start of GitHub organizations
October: Average month, code distancing, and the continuing rise of git-image projects
November: Mass archival, mass projects, and first (failed) submission work
December: Wrapping up the year and the rise of the project language file, Meadows going online
```

#### Phases of the year (2021)

For this year, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml
January: Year preparation
February: Degoogle 2021
March: Discussion and code distancing
April: The race to join 100 commits each era/untitled month
May: GitHub platform month, organization documentation and creation celebration and acceleration
June: Robotics month, and GitHub organization documentation finalization, and Gist revival, the dawn of the GitHub pages era, web 2.0.1
July: Linux celebration month, GitHub pages era part II
August: Coming soon
September: Coming soon
October: Coming soon
November: Coming soon
December: Coming soon
```

#### Compared to yesterday

Compared to yesterday, I spent a lot less time playing games. - July 31st 2021

#### GitHub organizations

GitHub organization work finished on June 26th 2021. I have not resumed work in a few days.

Some work was done today, 4 new organizations were created. - July 13th 2021

Some work was done again today, I found a small flaw and fixed it. 1 new organization was created - July 14th 2021.

Work resumed again on July 16th 2021, but I didn't finish documenting it today, so I will have to wrap up tomorrow. - July 16th 2021

Worked resumed again today a few days late. I created 3 organizations and finished documenting it. - July 19th 2021

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 10,200 (10.2K) stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"""notice:"""

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is how you do so:

"""how"""

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

"""alternatively"""

# You can go to the projects menu and see the exact amount (if you have access, I haven't tested this with non-seanpm2001 accounts yet)

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from a couple weeks ago was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

Some other recent changes I don't like include:

* 1. Location cannot be customized in organizations or user profiles - June 22nd 2021

* 2. Task lists have circular progress bars now, instead of a rectangular one, with no way to change it back - June 23rd 2021

* 3. The hover text for the commit calendar is now too bloated - July 31st 2021 to August 1st 2021, still ongoing as of August 3rd 2021

* 4. GitHub organizations getting redesigned and losing functionality and look too compact (you can't see how long ago a project was modifed anymore, and you can only see 10 projects at a time, breaking the view, and the sorting options. It wasn't broken Microsoft, why did you bring out the sledgehammer? - This actually really upset me yesterday (August 3rd 2021) but I didn't mention it until today (August 5th 2021)

**What is the 25 project limit**

* GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

I have decided to start listing things I like about GitHub, as I don't want a fully negative experience.

<!-- Make a list of all the things you like about GitHub !-->

* 1. I like the GitHub linguist and its color codes. Ruby in dark mode reminds me of a certain part of my childhood

* 2. There are some skeuomorphic/detailed elements, and it is not all flat and boring. It seems like new skeuomorphic elements are being added (as of July 14th 2021)

* 3. There is some unique dialogue when an error happens, such as "yowsa, thats a lot of files"

* 4. Linux, BSD, MacOS, and other non-Windows support is available, along with support for various browsers. It isn't locked into just Google Chrome, and the site follows WHATWG web standards

* 5. The community is a lot friendlier and more professional (at least 100x) when compared to that of a site like YouTube

* 6. The site does a good job at tracking problems and fixing them

* 7. The site implements the Git version control system well

* 8. README Indexes are really neat, I really liked when they were introduced.

* 9. The site has a dark mode, but the people at GitHub went the extra mile and kept light mode, and even added a dark mode that is slightly dimmed for people who prefer it

* 10. The animation at the homepage is pretty cool, although a bit CPU intensive on Linux (like most other things, as my current computer has a poor GPU)

* 11. The "Secret" username/username repository is a good feature

* 12. More entries coming soon

#### Summer vacation #1

Ended, back home. See past status updates for more info.

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today. - June 26th 2021

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files on Sunday, June 13th 2021, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

On Monday, June 15th 2021, I tested this trick for MediaWiki, which GitHub recognizes as WikiText. Here is the `.gitattributes` sample file used:

##### WikiText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.wiki linguist-detectable=true
*.wiki linguist-documentation=false
```

Also:

##### YAML Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.yml linguist-detectable=true
*.yml linguist-documentation=false
*.yaml linguist-detectable=true
*.yaml linguist-documentation=false
```

##### ReStructuredText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.rst linguist-detectable=true
*.rst linguist-documentation=false
```

##### WebVTT Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.vtt linguist-detectable=true
*.vtt linguist-documentation=false
```

##### KiXtart Gitattributes (unsuccessful)

```gitattributes
*.kix linguist-detectable=true
*.kix linguist-documentation=false
```

I have not tested any other languages, I am still trying to test .svg .gitattributes .gitignore and .txt

#### Giving ProtonMail a 2nd chance

I am still very upset with ProtonMail, but I have decided to give them a second chance today, and try to work through some issues via movements, and contacting the people at the lovely Switzerland office. I will get into contacts with ProtonMail, and learn this new mess of a UI.

As of August 5th 2021, I have not tried ProtonMail again since the last login. I am extremely disappointed, as I may have permanently lost contact with a friend due to this.

#### Socializing

#### Maintainers

Currently, I am the only maintainer for my GitHub projects. I am looking for new maintainers at the moment. I can't do all this by myself.

I am really looking for maintainers. I will train you myself if needed, but I only want people who enjoy doing it/really want to do it.

Maintenance is needed on my projects. I will get each project ready for maintenance by you or someone else. Please _**@**_ me for the training course.

On June 21st 2021, I made a repository outlining the beginning of my maintainer guidelines. You can view it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Maintainers-info)

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 45+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today. - June 23rd 2021

The todo list has been getting scattered development, most easy and medium tasks are being done, but not large or immersive projects - June 26th 2021

#### Year In Review GitHub Year 1 progress

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I didn't make any progress on this goal today - July 3rd 2021

I haven't made progress on this in months. - July 14th 2021

#### Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

I failed to catch up on MB/DDG work today - July 4th 2021

I still did not catch up on MB/DDG image work today. - July 5th 2021

I caught up on MB/DDG image work tonight. I have been noticing a pattern of me falling behind on this, then catching up every 3 days. I would like to have it be a daily thing, but if it is normal for my mind and workload, this fine. - July 6th 2021

I did not catch up today, but I did add new data, relating to a theory I had on the possible existence of the original lifeforms of this planet (that they may still be alive, and what we could learn from them if we managed to explore the ocean and possibly find them) and also fishtank specifications. - July 7th 2021

#### The future of TRM

Currently, my brand names have 3 layers

Ancient: TRM (2015-2018) (August 3rd 2021-present)

Medieval: Seanwallawalla (2015-2018) (partially: 2020-present)

Modern: Seanpm2001 (2020-present)

TRM has been mostly abandoned for several years, with the exception of the TRM brand being defined and documented in 2020, and 2021. It has mostly just been a TeamTDM ripoff, and hasn't been used seriously since 2018. I decided to change the acronym today (August 3rd 2021) from:

**T**he

I**r**on

**M**elon

(it has technically just been Tim this whole time)

to:

**T**he

**R**eal

**M**yrick

The name was recommended by my Dad, and is a reference to the metaphor [The Real McCoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_real_McCoy) the original acronym might be archived into the name T-TIM (Team: The Iron Melon)

#### Vexillology work

I have been planning this for a few days, but I now plan on hosting a mirror of the site FOTW.info which is one of the top Vexillology (study of flags) sites. Today, I decided it would be too cumbersome to do by hand every day/week/month, so I have started work on getting the project automated. There is still work to go on this.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Clean slate

Next clean slate is ready on September 1st 2021.

#### And finally...

Today was a better day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I was wearing down while putting the finishing touches on this status post. I can't go any further today unfortunately. I really want to do more.

#### Miscellaneous notes

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.

I am trying to burn this into my brain, as I forget sometimes when asked about my projects, which is:

"don't ever be afraid to be yourself, as being yourself is all of who you are"

and also:

"if you try to be someone you are not, you will be found out as a fraud in the future"

People don't usually forget this, but I need to give this advice to myself, as I sometimes forget it when asked about what my projects are and what they do.

These status posts are going to be shortened eventually, I am still figuring out how to do so in a clean manner.
