Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

Mention: I am using Social Media and the Internet the way it should be, uncensored talks and about the creator, and not about a company (like the Internet used to be like partially before 2007)

I have been meaning to mention this for a while, but my cellular device has been having an on and off problem for over a month now, where a certain screenshot I take every once in a while (and the 0-6 screenshots after it) will not hide the screenshot preview until it fully expires (this process can‚Äôt be rushed) and afterwards, the problem by this screenshot lag will either cause the phone to become unresponsive until you turn off the screen or let you continue but have all buttons break and zooming to become completely broken and forced. The fix to this is to minimize and maximize the current app, then turn the phone off and turn it back on and quickly minimize and maximize the app. It it tedious as hell. It started in July 2021.

I got the normal work done today, but didn't get to unique programming projects as planned. I hope things return to normal later next week.

I had a good day with development today, I did the usual work, and did lots of template work. I also did some debugging and fixed the GitHub pages issue (partially) I found what file was causing the problem `INSTALL` and for now, all I can do is remove it. I am comfortable in my template environment.

Along with this, I didn't do anything else today. I skipped Marine Biology and DDG work today. As of recently, I started doing my journaling first thing instead of last.

### YouTube-DL Legacy

It has been pointed out to me that YouTube-DL development has stalled significantly. It hasn't been updated since June 30th 2021, nearly 2 whole months. YouTube-DL has been incredibly helpful to the world, and it has faced significant opposition by evil forces (such as the RIAA and other 3-4 letter corps) and I hate to see it go. I don't want its legacy to be in vein, and I don't want to just replace it with another downloader, but I might end up having to, as YouTube and other restrictive sites will eventually update their systems to the point that an update to YouTube-DL is required for continued circumvention. So far, it is still working, and there are lots of spinoff projects. If anyone can contact the maintainers of the project and get info on how they are doing so, I encourage you to try. I heard that one of the maintainers was last seen editing Wikipedia on August 23rd 2021.

### Firefox loses 50 million users

So recently, Firefox lost 50 million of its users. I am pretty sure one major part of this was due to Mozilla not listening to their users and doing stupid things like adding Proton Tabs, which the majority of users (including me) hated. It is why I still running Firefox 88.0.1 and haven't gone on to 89.0 or later versions.

I plan to stick with Firefox as long as I can, until a good competitor comes out, but it will still be sad to see it go. I currently have my eyes on Konquerer, DotBrowser, DuckDuckGo browser, and Tor. There aren't enough good alternatives to Chromium, and until more are available, I will continue to support Gecko based browsers and other non-Chromium browsers.

Non-Chromium alternatives to Firefox so far (As of August 24th 2021, highly incomplete)

* Basilisk (Windows only)

* Comodo IceDragon (Windows only)

* Dot Browser [View on GitHub](https://github.com/dothq/browser)

* DuckDuckGo browser (Currently only Android and iOS are supported)

* Konquerer

* Pale Moon

* Tor (breaks most websites completely, due to lots of websites using non-standard features (violation of WHATWG standards))

* Waterfox

### Install file problem

I have been experimenting with special files `authors` `credits` `copying` `install` `makefile` in my projects and have had recent difficulty with `install` as it is not working with GitHub pages and crashes in 0 seconds with an unspecified error. I had to widdle the problem down to this file originally, as I had to figure out which of the 7 (now 8) new files are causing the problem. - August 23rd 2021

I have noted that GitHub doesn't like the contents of the file, because no matter what I name it (`INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE` `INTSTALL` `iSTALL` and `HOWTO`) all result in a page build error. I am still looking into the problem. - August 24th 2021

**This section was last updated on 2021, Tuesday August 24th at 8:58 pm**

### Security reports

I have noted that several countries (such as the United States and China) have began adopting a social credit system (The US is in the process of doing so) it is a major threat to user privacy, but I found a way to bring the economy down overnight and destroy the social credit system in the process:

Since this system does not like when people search for certain things and will lower your credit score by doing so, you can completely destroy your credit by searching for a ton of things that would give red flags. All it takes is a search history destroyer targetted towards millions of people, and it will destroy the credit of all these people, and would simultaneously crash the credit system overnight. I don't have the hacking skills to do it, but I know someone is going to attempt it. It is an unfair system, which is why I am disclosing this zero day vulnerability without warning.

The people in charge of this have 2 options after this possible attack happens:

Reverse the decision and attempt to salvage peoples credit (the good option, although you will have already taken significant damage)

Ignore the attacks, continue the system, and deal with economic downturn (the bad option, may cause a 2nd great depression)

### Date change

On 2022, January 1st, I will be completely switching my date format from `MM-DD-YYYY` to `YYYY-MM-DD`, in compliance with [ISO:8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) I have been doing this in a semi-fashion since month 1 on GitHub (you can see this in directory paths, as I have been doing it like `YYYY-MM-DD` (example: `/2021/08_August/11/`) the entire time, so this will be unchanged) and after a week of decision (August 4th 2021 to August 11th 2021) I have decided to make the switch everywhere, starting next year.

It is a very simple change, and as of August 12th 2021, I have already began to try and practice doing it, but it is still a bit difficult. Arch Linux's version numbers will be a support method for me, as it is in that format already. I didn't think it was going to be this difficult, all I have to do is switch the year piece from the end to the beginning of the wordnum block.

#### Why January 1st

I decided that it is most appropriate to make this change on the first day of the year, as to prevent errors with dates in the current year, as with the format being switched to, duplication/bad date errors can occur. I also need time to prepare for this change. The decision will go live on 2022, January 1st at 12:00:00:0000 am.

#### Learn more

Here is some information from the ISO website:

##### What can ISO 8601 do for me?

When dates are represented with numbers they can be interpreted in different ways. For example, 01/05/12 could mean January 5, 2012, or May 1, 2012. On an individual level this uncertainty can be very frustrating, in a business context it can be very expensive. Organizing meetings and deliveries, writing contracts and buying airplane tickets can be very difficult when the date is unclear.

ISO 8601 tackles this uncertainty by setting out an internationally agreed way to represent dates:

`YYYY-MM-DD`

For example, September 27, 2012 is represented as 2012-09-27.

ISO 8601 can be used by anyone who wants to use a standardized way of presenting:

* Date

* Time of day

* Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

* Local time with offset to UTC

* Date and time

* Time intervals

* Recurring time intervals

### Progress

As of August 12th 2021, I have already began to try and practice doing it, but it is still a bit difficult. Arch Linux's version numbers will be a support method for me, as it is in that format already. I didn't think it was going to be this difficult, all I have to do is switch the year piece from the end to the beginning of the wordnum block.

It is still a very difficult process, but I accept change. I am spreading the concept everywhere early, so that the reminder for it grows strong to continue its colonization of the standard for however long it takes to get used to it. - August 13th 2021

I have decided to not write /2020.08.14/ anymore, and replace it with simply /14/ as it is more readable and less cluttered, and a lot easier to get used to. - August 14th 2021

I am getting better with it, but I am still struggling to put it everywhere. For the file portion, I am doing pretty well everywhere except for in commit descriptions and certain `README` files. - August 15th 2021

No updates for today, I am just continuing with it. - August 16th 2021

Compliance has slowed recently, I am working on catching back up. - August 17th 2021

Compliance has slightly increased today, I am still trying to figure out punctuation in dates. I have realized that the possible problem of confusing Americans is gone, as I don't write dates like 11-12-21 (21-11-12) I guess that just isn't possible with how I write dates. - August 18th 2021

Compliance is waning again. - August 19th 2021 to August 24th 2021

### Planning for my next laptop (2021 edition)

I began planning for my next laptop last night, as I need to start getting more prepared for the next system.

I am really considering giving my next laptop 32 gigabytes of RAM to keep up with what I am doing, and maybe get my desired workflow (up to 5-12 Firefox browser windows open at once all the time, being able to load 2000x25000 resolution images with ease, not having to constantly close programs to free SWAP, being able to have several LibreOffice documents open at once without having to worry about SWAP, maybe some virtual machines, etc.)

I am also considering a decatohecto (16, if the word isn't definied, use duo-octo) core processor, a 2 terabyte SSD, USB ports, the device will be heavier, good battery life, Ubuntu may be swapped with another Linux distribution, but I am really going to try and go for KDE this time, as I learned my lesson with not switching from GNOME on day 1 and deeming it acceptable.

I may wait for the semiconductor shortage to end first, if it is not improved in 1-2 years, I will get the new device anyways

Screen resolution: minimum: 1920x1080, may try for: 2560x1440 or higher

Refresh rate: minimum: 60 hz, may try for: whatever is available and cheap enough, may just stick with 60hz (60 fps)

Color type: minimum: 24 bit color, may try for: whatever is available and cheap enough, may go for 32 bit color to see what it is like

Processor type: AMD, Intel, or whatever I feel comfortable with, most likely will be AMD or Intel, obviously will be x64

Operating system: Definitely Linux, although I am still deciding if I want to stick with Ubuntu

Battery: still trying to find the amp hours of my current laptop, although I have found that my current device is 51 Watt Hours, which is a completely different measurement of power. Whatever I have now for amp hours, I plan to have at least double of that on my next laptop (aiming for triple or quadruple)

Keyboard: MUST be mechanical, or capable of being replaced with a mechanical keyboard. Also obviously must be US QWERTY layout, although I will be accepting of any Latin-based keyboard, including Icelandic (although it is unlikely that I will get anything other than English (US) (QWERTY)) I also need a function (`fn`) key (specifying this, as not all keyboards have this)

I may have given a poor definition of mechanical keyboard/not used the right term. I think I am referring to a metallic durable keyboard, I am told this might be just called "metal keyboard" but I feel like I am looking for a mechanical keyboard. - August 18th 2021

### Possible keyboard issues arise (2021 August 17th)

Less than 3 months after my gruesome laptop breakdown period after replacing my keyboard and getting my operating system wiped, my keyboard is already starting to show signs of problems again. It has only been `89` days since the repair, and I still haven't fully recovered from the last incident. Leave it to me to wear out a brand new keyboard in less than 3 months, I am for sure switching to a mechanical keyboard from now on, no matter how difficult it is to get a good laptop with one.

I have not entirely confirmed it yet, but it is showing signs of problems with 2 keys `d` and `n` - August 17th 2021

The issue is getting worse, and now 6 keys are having problems: `d` `n` `,` `rshift` `lctrl` and `i` - August 18th 2021

The keyboard has gotten a lot better starting last night. - August 19th 2021

No issues. - August 20th to August 24th 2021

### Swisscows

I have discovered the Swisscows open source privacy based search engine today, it has some relatively good reviews in the privacy community, although I still like DuckDuckGo better, as DuckDuckGo has a better UI to me. It is still a very good resource to have, every good private search engine is a major contribution to the world.

### COVID-19 pandemic

As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic started in December 2019, and is still ongoing, as of August 19th 2021. Misinformation has played a major role in increasing the mortality of the virus, as many people in many countries are refusing to get vaccinated due to conspiracy theories, general misinformation, cult beliefs, and general hesitancy. I am keeping this section here to inform people with basic helpful information about the virus, as every person I reach out to can save multiple lives (1 person learning can spread to more people, thus resulting in fewer cases with more vaccination) I know I have a small voice, but I feel like I need to do my part, everybody does (unless you are spreading misinformation, then please, JUST STOP!!!)

I am aware that the pandemic has become very politicized globally, and that there are many crackdowns across various social media sites. Due to my political containment policy, I will not be talking politically here, and I want to remind you that the health of a species is not and should not be based on party/partisan poltiics. I am aware that there is a risk to posting about COVID-19 due to crackdowns, but it is a risk I am willing to take, and you should take as well. I already started the [code distancing](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-Distancing/) project, which gives more information related to the pandemic, so this isn't my first time talking about this publicly.

#### Privacy

I am on my way to becoming a privacy advocate. I can 100% guarantee you that there are **NO** microchips in a COVID-19 vaccine, this is a popular conspiracy theory that I felt the need to debunk right away. While I am at it, 5G Internet doesn't give you diseases, that is not how cellular networks work. 

#### How to get a vaccine painlessly

A lot of people fear the needle of a vaccine, even if they aren't hesistant towards vaccines in other ways. I can assure you that most doctors and nurses administering the vaccine really know what they are doing and are very careful. I have some advice for you that helped me:

* Don't look at the needle: before you get the shot, look to the left (or to the right, it is your preference) until you feel a tiny shock. Doing this, the receival of the vaccine will be almost entirely painless. You will feel a small sting, but it is a lot better than the fear of looking at the needle as it is going in. When I was younger, I used to scream while receiving the vaccine (sorry to anybody I upset by doing this back then) recently, I learnt this trick, and it has worked really well.

Yes, you may be sore afterwards, but the soreness isn't very painful at all, and most likely will not prevent you from doing day-to-day activities. It is better than dying a horrible, gruesome, lonely death on a ventilater without being able to see anyone, it is truly a horrible, horrible way to die. I would list it as one of the top 3 worst possible ways to die.

#### Getting a 3rd shot

Starting in September, people who had their first 2 vaccines will be capable of getting a 3rd shot, known as a booster shot. You made it to this point, remember that there are lots of people who won't even get their first shot yet. People can change, more will be joining us shortly.

It is highly recommended to get your booster shot when you can, it is available to you 8 months after your second shot, which comes 2 weeks after your first shot.

#### Airliners

There have been lots of incidents on airplanes and other public transit of people freaking out and using domestic abuse over mask mandates, and now it is resulting in people receiving fines between $40,000.00 and $500,000.00. Don't be an ahole, just comply. It is ridiculous that so many people would rather have a half million dollar fine, than a completely free vaccine.

#### Sources

I will add sources in the future, although some of this content cannot be sourced, as it is original research (such as the "how to get a vaccine painlessly" section)

Stay safe!

Source1: my dad (registered Nurse, Fire commissioner since 2016, and long-time Firefighter, a very funny and kind man)

### Mental health

The schedule I have gotten myself into has been really hard on me. I have a lot of worries that most people never have cross their minds. I am constantly trying to fix the world with every possible solution I come up with, and at the cost of such a large scope of subjects, I deal with millions of negative thoughts. Just what I am writing now may add 2-6 negative thoughts to my head, which cycle through 24/7 over a looping course of 2 months (and my brain never forgets negative thoughts and experiences)

I have built up a good tolerance to it, so don't worry too much about me. If you notice me behaving poorly, or writing really negative personal experiences, my shields (tolerance to negativity) are probably down, and you might want to try and help me out (my most recent down period was July 26th to July 30th 2021) I have considered getting an assistant to help me in the future, but I decided not to, as I don't want to be dependant on a caretaker until I am elderly (even then, I don't know if I would want that)

Mental health is a real problem. I have struggled with depression since 2009, and have dealt with Nihilism/Existentialism on and off since 2011 (which is a recursive forkbomb to my brain) if you struggle with mental health as well, we should try to support each other and reach out to help more people.

My mental health is really not doing well lately due to my nonstop cognitive load and hardly any breaks. I really need help finding another person who would like to work with me on my projects. - August 20th 2021

### GitHub and Scratch

Ever since Wednesday, 2021 August 11th, I have recently started to get nostalgia for Scratch again. I have now noted that the GitHub community really reminds me of Scratch (to be more clear, it is similar to a much more advanced version of "scratch" with strong community style nostalgia) there is something about programmers getting together and programming together that gives off this really good vibe.

### Express yourself

I am using Social Media and the Internet the way it should be, uncensored talks and about the creator, and not about a company (like the Internet used to be like partially before 2007) I am working on bringing a comeback to the non-corporate Internet, without the norm of people touting misinformation and other bullshit.

### Android screenshot problem (possibly defective S20 screen)

I have been meaning to mention this for a while, but my cellular device has been having an on and off problem for over a month now, where a certain screenshot I take every once in a while (and the 0-6 screenshots after it) will not hide the screenshot preview until it fully expires (this process can‚Äôt be rushed) and afterwards, the problem by this screenshot lag will either cause the phone to become unresponsive until you turn off the screen or let you continue but have all buttons break and zooming to become completely broken and forced. The fix to this is to minimize and maximize the current app, then turn the phone off and turn it back on and quickly minimize and maximize the app. It it tedious as hell. It started in July 2021.

### Apple iCloud August 2021 controversy

**THIS SECTION IS OUTDATED**

Today, I learned of something stupid Apple did. They are now scanning all iCloud media for child abuse content. Now you are probably asking, how is that bad? Don‚Äôt you hate child abuse? Yes I do, but there is a massive flaw with this: algorithms aren‚Äôt that good yet. When I was using OneDrive, it had such poor recognition of everyday objects that it was incredibly laughable. Applying this filter is like using Google Translate to pass a PhD College exam in Esperanto, It isn‚Äôt accurate enough. I think that Apple should still try this, but they shouldn‚Äôt pull a Google/YouTube and leave everything to the machine, there needs to be people checking the incidents of child abuse to make sure it isn‚Äôt someone doing something innocent like recording videos of a fish that the algorithm may think is of someone dropkicking a child down the stairs, as the algorithm really can be that bad. Imagine taking a picture of a burrito and uploading it to iCloud, then having the FBI come and arrest you and take away your children, because the algorithm was that bad. Algorithms are easily fooled. YouTube is a very primary example of this.

The problem: leaving it to the machines

The solution: have a real person or a team of people (if a single person can't be trusted) verify each claim of child abuse to make sure the algorithm isn't sending an innocent person to prison

**DETADTUO SI NOITCES SIHT**

I am keeping this section until I can document it better, the situation is worse than expected. I wasn't aware enough of this, and I know that this is a bad thing, and that Apple is falling on its small privacy platform, which was never really very legitimate due to the majority of Apple software being proprietary. This is yet another example of the "Think of the Children" argument, where emotions are evoked as children are used as scapegoats, so that Apple can take away user freedom without much setback. This strategy has unfortunately worked many times ever since the September 11th 2001 attacks, but luckily, society seems to be figuring this out, as it wasn't received well by the privacy community and people outside of the privacy community. Facebook even had the audacity to make an announcement that they oppose this, while good, they are in absolutely no position to say anything, and they are trying to look like the good guys by taking advantage of a weakened Apple.

This is Apple performing what is called `damage control` they know that if they were just caught doing this, it would create a much bigger controversy. Because they did it like this, it created a controversy, but unfortunately, people are likely to forget about it and move on.

**... But not everyone will forget and move on...**

This will live on in their history, and time will not heal this wound. Apple is completely rotten now, and needs to be thrown in the trash.

### Ecosia

I started using Ecosia more heavily again today, I unfortunately stopped using it for a while. Today, I did research and found that it takes about 8.8 (9) trees to make up for 1 gallon of gasoline being used daily, if each tree were to take out 1 kilogram of carbon. The number is pretty saddening, and since I can't plant any trees at my house at the moment, I decided to emphasize Ecosia again, and try to plant at least 900 trees to make up for all the gasoline my close family has used. This will take a while, as that is about 900x45 (40500) searches, but I am hoping that I can spread the popularity and message of Ecosia to speed this up.
- August 4th 2021

I used Ecosia again today. - August 5th 2021

I unfortunately didn't use Ecosia today. - August 6th to August 18th 2021

I may have abused Ecosia, and I am sorry. I thought you were supposed to spam random searches into it. - August 18th 2021

NOTE: Part of my goal for doubled DDG and ECOSIA ads failed, as DuckDuckGo is no longer advertising on TV, I am still awaiting their next ad, hopefully it is better than the first one. They should honestly use the Big tech = Stalin one

I didn't use Ecosia today. - August 19th to August 24th 2021

### Lowering my expectations

My mind recently messed up a little bit when I failed to work on 25 different repositories for 3 days in a row, and also getting 200 commits. These expectations are being removed, and being replaced with a "whatver I can do comfortably" amount. This was an issue on July 16th 2021, but as of July 20th 2021, I have recovered.

This was part of a down period, another down period occurred less than 6 days later and was much worse. Since then (as of August 17th 2021) it has gotten much better, thanks to the lowering of ridiculous expectations. I still reach them every once in a while, just not every day

There were some minor mouse issues upon shutdown last night, but it might have been due to the system going very slow at the time for some reason - July 9th 2021

Still no recourrence today. - July 10th 2021

Still no recourrence today. - July 11th 2021

A possible reoccurence today, the mouse didn't freeze entirely, but it lagged several times. - July 12th 2021

Dragging files was increasingly difficult at one point, stopping the process of letting me drag files before it could escape the window, I felt like it was a bug with GNOME files/Nautilus. I remember my unstable XPS-13 doing this, it is similar to a cursor bug, but it wasn't a cursor freezing bug. - July 13th 2021

No issues today - July 14th 2021

No issues today... yet - July 15th 2021

The issue reoccurred today. The caps lock light got stuck on, and also required 2 presses for CAPS LOCK and 1 press for caps lock, and 4 minutes later, the mouse crashed. I was already upset by the caps lock button that the mouse issue felt normal, as they seemed to be connected. My heart didn't even race, but I hope it does not reoccur. It simply took typing `gnome-extensions` to fix it. - July 16th 2021

It was fine today. - July 17th 2021

It was fine again today. - July 18th 2021

No issues with this again today. - July 19th 2021

My cursor has been acting a bit weird tonight, but it hasn't crashed yet (as of 11:13 pm) - July 20th 2021

The cursor was a bit finnicky today, but overall, it was fine and didn't crash (as of 11:52 pm) - July 21st 2021

Everything was fine cursor wise today (As of Thursday, July 22nd 2021 at 11:59:59:9999) - July 22nd 2021

Everything is fine so far (as of Friday, July 23rd 2021 at 12:08 am) No new data, everything is fine. :-} - July 23rd 2021

No reoccurence today, everything was perfect today. - August 5th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything was perfect again today. - August 6th 2021

The caps lock key went out, and it was acting weird beforehand. I knew exactly where this was going, so I saved everything and restarted. I am not sure if this counts as a crash. Other than this, everything was fine today. - August 7th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything was perfect today. - August 8th 2021

The SD card had some minor difficulties today, but other than that, everything was perfect today. - August 9th 2021

The SD card had some minor difficulties again today, but other than that, everything was perfect today. - August 10th 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, and my laptop had some Bluetooth connection problems. My headphones crashed 4 times today, and Ubuntu refused to let me disconnect my headphones the 4th time without completely disabling Bluetooth. I haven't tried restarting yet. My computer almost crashed twice in the process, and was a bit slow at times before, during, and after the crashes today. - August 11th 2021

Along with this, there was an issue, where the shift key got stuck, and CTRL commands didn't work, several other buttons didn't work, and due to middleclick, every time I went to check on a program, it opened a new window. It lasted for over 6 minutes, but eventually became stable again. I didn't have to restart, but I probably should have. No further issues occurred. - August 12th 2021

There were no major technical issues today. - August 13th 2021 to August 22nd 2021

The cursor froze up today, and I couldn't access the terminal with the `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `T` shortcut, but it recovered on its own, and didn't occur again today. - August 23rd 2021

There were no major technical issues today. - August 24th 2021

#### Tribute to Dennis Ritchie

I did not work on the Tribute project to Dennis Ritchie today. Updates are waiting for his posthumous birthday on September 9th (the next occurence being September 9th 2021, in `46` days from today (This section was last updated on July 24th 2021)

##### Computer crash

_Crashes before June 18th 2021 are not listed here._

**As part of a cleanup process on this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

I thought the Wi-Fi symbol just became glitched, but it wasn't an error, our Internet just failed, the whole city won't have Internet until about 8 pm, so I will have to work offline for 3 hours. So much for Spectrums "99.9% reliability" this isn't even the first time this year that the Internet has gone out here. No other problems today. - July 4th 2021

There was a small 6 second freeze today, but that was it - July 5th 2021

There were no new crashes today. I decided to reinstall GIMP so I could do some graphic design work. I am yet to see if this is going to cause problems. There was another small 6 second freeze today, but that was it. I am wondering if having music playing helps prevent the lag from crashing the system. It is better than Windows at least, because if it crashes, it is a bit more calm and will continue to play music up until the screen goes black, rather than scaring the s##t out of me when it starts loudly buzzing and flickering, and then crashing. - July 6th 2021

No technical issues today - July 7th 2021

It was a bit difficult mounting my SD card today, but the recent issue with Dongles has been resolved, as my hard drive was recognized, just not the SD card. I also successfully did a hard drive backup today. - July 8th 2021

Everything IO wise is fine right now, and there was no instability today. - July 9th 2021

There was some slowness last night, the cursor lagged a bit and made my heart race, but it quickly came back within 1.3 seconds. The whole system was going slow, and I was shutting down. Additionally, it got stuck at a black screen for over 20 seconds during the shutdown process before turning off, which really worried me. - July 9th 2021

The SD card is still slightly difficult to mount, but everything else is fine IO wise. The system is still stable, as of 9:28 pm. - July 10th 2021

The SD card was perfect today, everything was fine IO wise, and there was no instability today. I recently got a new USB C to USB C cord, but I messed up on something, and I wasn't able to charge my laptop through a portable battery like I wanted. My laptop doesn't recognize it in the 8 different ways I plugged it in. It will still be a useful piece of equipment to have. - July 11th 2021

The SD card was nearly perfect today, everything was fine IO wise, and there was some slight instability. - July 12th 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, everything else was fine IO wise, there was a minor cursor issue today (see above) and there were no other issues today. - July 13th 2021

There was no instability today, unless you count IO issues, of which the SD card is still being difficult. - July 14th 2021

The SD card was incredibly unstable today, and took nearly 100 unmounts/remounts + 1 system restart to eventually detect. I don't know how much longer I can sustain this. Unfortunately, USB is not an option for everyday use. Also earlier today, my keyboard light kept dimming 5x faster than it normally does. It isn't too big of a deal, so I just turned it off. I hope it doesn't mean there will be further keyboard issues. I also tested it again at 10:29 pm, it is fine again. That is all that happened today with difficulties in computing. - July 15th 2021

The SD card finally mounted at the same time I got an recommended updates notification. The SD card wasn't nearly as bad as yesterday. My system felt a bit clunky today. The mouse cursor issue reoccurred today. 4 minutes prior, another issue started up. The caps lock light got stuck on, and also required 2 presses for CAPS LOCK and 1 press for caps lock, and 4 minutes later, the mouse crashed. I was already upset by the caps lock button that the mouse issue felt normal, as they seemed to be connected. My heart didn't even race, but I hope it does not reoccur. - July 16th 2021

The SD card was a real pain today, but it still works. My keyboard was a bit dirty earlier, and all the keys were having problems. After lots of crunching, it is fixed. - July 17th 2021

The SD card was very difficult today, but I got it to work. I also messed up and didn't have all the files handy the first time, so I had to do it twice. Luckily, it was far less difficult the second time. Other than that, there were no other technical issues today. - July 18th 2021

The only problem today was IO functionality, which I have still not found a root cause to. - July 19th 2021

The SD card wasn't too difficult today. It still is a problem. There was also some sporadic cursor movements at time while writing this status file tonight. - July 20th 2021

The SD card was very, very difficult today, taking hundreds of ummounts, running this command:

```shell
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/rescan
```

doing a system restart, and dealing with over 42 minutes of IO errors before I could access the SD card. The laptop was also acting a bit finnicky at times today, and had 2 internal errors due to `tracker-miner-fs` breaking as usual, as I decided not to kill it early on (it has always been broken for me, and uses up over 1 GiB of RAM and 30 MiB of SWAP when not killed, alongside 20-90% overall CPU usage (combined across 8 CPU cores) for 30 minutes to 6 hours. If you are having a similar problem, here is what I have to type into the terminal daily to fix it:

```shell
tracker reset --hard
```

Don't be afraid to run it. I have ran it on 3 different installations of Ubuntu across the past year and nearly 1 month a few hundreds times and have not received any damaged data from it.

Other than that, it was fine. - July 21st 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, but not nearly as bad as yesterday. No sore thumbs. Judging by my data for the past 10 days, it is only going to get worse tomorrow. This is not a 100% there is still hope that it won't be difficult. - July 22nd 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, but it was hardly a problem. It was easier than yesterday, so it broke my data pattern. - July 23rd 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, but it was hardly a problem. It was actually easier than yesterday, so it broke my data pattern again. - July 24th 2021

The GNOME shell restarted today due to too frequent file saving. It was a user error, nothing was lost, and it was fine. Also, my SD card has been getting easier and easier to mount. Lately, it has taken dozens to hundreds of attempts, and in the past 3 days, it has gotten increasingly easier to mount. Today, I got it on the 3rd try. - July 25th 2021

There were a couple small system freezes today that lasted 6 seconds each, but none of them resulted in a crash. The SD card was very easy today, working on the first mount. I finally figured out the technique of putting it in to the exact nanometer for it to work properly. No other issues today. - July 26th 2021

There were no technical difficulties today. - July 27th 2021

There were a few program crashes today (nautilus, and a self-inflicted mutter crash by typing `mutter` into Konsole, as I recently found that this causes `Mutter` to have a segmentation fault and perform a core dump. Afterwards, my volume sound effects weren't working until nautilus crashed a second time, although audio still played before and after all crashes) the SD card was again fine today, and there were no other issues. - July 28th 2021

There were some program crashes again today, it was nautilus (GNOME files) again. Other than that, everything was fine. The SD card is also still performing nearly perfectly. - July 29th 2021

There was no instability today, and the SD card performed decently again. - July 30th 2021

There was 1 near crash today, and the SD card performed slightly worse today. - July 31st 2021

There was no instability today, the SD card performed slightly better today. - August 1st 2021

There was no instability today, the SD card performed worse today, mounting itself quickly, but constantly randomly unmounting itself, even during the copy process. - August 2nd 2021

There was minor instability today, with an XORG crash bringing my system down at 22:45:17 (10:45 pm) and continued issues with the SD card unmounting itself, and also taking a long time to connect. - August 3rd 2021

There was no instability today. The SD card didn't randomly unmount, it is just back to taking a long time to detect. - August 4th 2021

Functionality was 100% perfect today, no crashes, no lag, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I hope it is the same tomorrow. - August 5th 2021

Functionality was 100% perfect again today, no crashes, no lag, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I hope it is the same again tomorrow. - August 6th 2021

Functionality was nearly perfect again today, there was 1 possible crash (I restarted before it could crash, so I don't know if that counts) some lag before the possible crash, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I am going to stop mentioning the SD card until it becomes a problem again. - August 7th 2021

Functionality was 100% perfect again today, no crashes, no lag, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I hope it is the same again tomorrow. - August 8th 2021

The SD card had some minor difficulties today, but other than that, everything was perfect today. - August 9th 2021 to August 10th 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, and my laptop had some Bluetooth connection problems. My headphones crashed 4 times today, and Ubuntu refused to let me disconnect my headphones the 4th time without completely disabling Bluetooth. I haven't tried restarting yet. My computer almost crashed twice in the process, and was a bit slow at times before, during, and after the crashes today. - August 11th 2021

The SD card was much more difficult today, and unmounted during the file transfer process. What was really cool about this is that only 1 large file was affected, and the moment the SD card was remounted, it continued the transfer like nothing happened. I re-copied the file and finalized the backup (it was todays fishtank video, the largest file in my daily backups) my headphones also refused to connect today via Bluetooth, and it was really annoying. During the process, Bluetooth disconnected (it got turned off) and refused to turn back on. I did some research and decided to take the risk of disabling and re-enabling Bluetooth, fearing it might break the system. It did, although Bluetooth was functional again (I could see the list of devices) but I couldn't connect anything.

Here are the commands I used:

`sudo rmmod btusb` - For removing/disabling Bluetooth

`sudo modprobe btusb` - For adding back/re-enabling Bluetooth

Later on, another issue occurred, where the shift key got stuck, and CTRL commands didn't work, several other buttons didn't work, and due to middleclick, every time I went to check on a program, it opened a new window. It lasted for over 6 minutes, but eventually became stable again. Overall, it was really difficult today. - August 12th 2021

The SD card was a bit difficult again today, but other than that, there were no technical problems today. - August 13th 2021

EXTRA: I decided to test out GNOME fonts, and the program lagged horribly, then crashed. I am really seeing with Linux that the community posts I read through about GNOME being the most bloated Linux desktop environment are true, it actually lives past the expectation I read about. GNOME is **HORRIBLE** with performance, this is just 1 out of several hundreds of examples. I really am regretting not starting with KDE, as originally planned. - August 13th 2021

There were no issues today. - August 14th 2021

There were no issues again today. - August 15th 2021 to August 16th 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, and the keyboard is already showing signs of severe wear, after less than 90 days. Other than that, everything is fine. - August 17th 2021 - To August 18th 2021

The SD card was very today, and the keyboard is already lessening signs of wear and tear (it is getting better someehow) of severe wear, after less than 90 days. Other than that, everything is fine. - August 19th 2021

The SD card was perfect again today, the D key is still acting a bit janky. Other than that, everything is still fine. - August 20th 2021

There was a scare with the bootloader today (see above) but other than that, everything was fine today. - August 21st 2021

The SD card was very difficult today, and I experienced near SWAP death this morning, but other than that, there were no major technical issues today. - August 22nd 2021

The cursor froze up today, and I couldn't access the terminal to try and fix it. Luckily, it fixed itself on its own. Today, I also found that blowing air into my SD card slot fixes the recent SD card difficulty. There were no other technical issues today. - August 23rd 2021

There were no technical issues today. - August 24th 2021

#### Windows 11

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries from June 16th 2021 to June 23rd 2021 have been removed. You can find them in older entries.**

Windows 11 released: **June 24th 2021**

My opinion on Windows 11 has shifted significantly based on the announcement, with a growing negative attitude towards it. My new concerns are:

1. The system requiring 4 gigabytes of RAM (not including applications)

2. The system requiring ~64 gigabytes of storage

3. The system requiring an Internet connection and Microsoft Account to install

4. No 32 bit support (this may be a problem for older computers as well, but we should already be moved on from 32 bit at this point, it has been 27 years since the first 64 bit general consumer system came out (Nintendo 64) and the first consumer Windows 64 bit desktop came out in 2005, so I don't consider this too bad)

I am negative towards all these, especially the 3rd entry. I feel like Windows 11 is getting far too bloated and the Internet requirement to install is really stupid, and may not be possible in countries where Internet connection is not good enough to download gigabytes of data. It also will make it much more difficult to get a Windows 11 virtual machine, which is needed for people who can't have a Windows device, similar to the problem where developers have to buy a Macbook to develop for Apple, you can't buy every single device to develop, it will make it too difficult. There was a reason why this was already so opposed on Windows 10. This might be a failing point for the system, Microsoft, you should take note in this, more people should point this out to them, as my voice alone is too small. Another thing I find ridiculous is the 4 gigabytes of RAM to run the operating system. Not everyone has a super powerful computer, I know people who only have 2 or less gigabytes of RAM and will not be able to get this, I have also had to warn everyone in my house about performance problems, as the Windows 10 devices in this house only have 4-6 gigabytes of RAM and already run the operating system very poorly, and will not be able to handle the update. Even with Linux, with over 8x less RAM usage than Windows 11 (with Ubuntu + GNOME, the most bloated Linux combination; I could get usage down to 256/512 megabytes if/when I switch to a lighter stack) I am struggling to run applications, even with 8 gigabytes of RAM. I don't see this going very well.

Finally, the storage requirement. Storage is getting cheaper, but this is still ridiculous for an operating system. When you compare Windows XP and Windows 11, it is obvious that bloat has gotten bad at warp speed (64 megabytes vs 4096 megabytes (RAM) 1.5 gigabytes vs 64 gigabytes (Storage, with some models requiring at least 1 terabyte of storage for some reason) 133 megahertz (1 core) vs 1 Gigahertz (2 cores) (CPU speed) 32 bit support vs no 32 bit support (CPU type)) - June 24th 2021

I forgot to mention this, but Windows 11 is still in beta, so some things can be changed. I don't have much hope in the RAM, CPU, or Storage usage problems being fixed, but I feel like if enough people bug, the issues with the Trusted Protections Module DRM problem and Internet connected install/Microsoft account issues can be fixed. - June 25th 2021

For the people who still use Windows and did not like Cortana, I have good news for you! Cortana is not included by default. I didn't have much against Cortana, I never developed an opinion on it, I just know that a lot of people couldn't stand her compared to other voice assistants. - June 29th 2021

I found out that Internet Explorer is officially discontinued now, which is good news for web developers. I will still be developing support for Internet Explorer via the BrowserNose project (quick summary: the BrowserNose project is a library that emulates support for every version of every web browser with as little feature loss as possible, all the way down to WorldWideWeb/Nexus (the first web browser) ) - June 29th 2021

This security thing TPM 2.0 is really sticking, I feel less hopeful about it being changed. Something I also forgot to mention was the removal of legacy BIOs support in favor of UEFI. I don't know enough about this to comment, other than it being another thing that prevents older computers from using Windows 11. - June 29th 2021

No new data, no new thoughts - June 30th 2021

No new thoughts, I did get to one of my extra goals today - July 1st 2021

My opinion towards the GUI is changing from negative to positive, I feel like Fluent Design is not the worst possible thing, and is a step towards skeuomorphism, which would be great, as minimalism sucks. I can actually tell this system apart from other systems now, unlike tens of thousands of releases of various operating systems and desktop environments from 2011 onward. Seriously, iOS 7 and up and Android 7 and up are pretty much identical in so many ways that I can hardly tell them apart. What is the point in designing a system if it isn't unique or different from the rest? Go and change the default wallpaper, and it is almost impossible to tell them apart, other than extremely small differences. - July 2nd 2021

Forcing users to get a 5 gigabyte OneDrive account isn't the best idea. Memory is really cheap nowadays, even in the expensive Solid State Drive format, I can get a terabyte of storage for $300 even with expensive solid state, which is 200x more storage more than a OneDrive account. I could get a 10 terabyte external hard drive for less than $250 and have over 2000 tkmes more space than having OneDrive and every one of its account offers. Cloud storage isn't for everyone. Has anyone seen the videos I am referencing, where OneDrive immediately re-opens when you close it - July 5th 2021

The Trusted Platforms Module DRM seems to be illegal for Russian and Chinese Windows users. This is a good thing. I wish DRM was illegal everywhere though. - July 17th 2021

I am extremely disappointed in the fact that Windows 11 home isn't as much of an operating system as it is a web service. If you have to use the Internet to install a 64 gigabyte operating system, completely dependant on that connection, with no offline disk image installation available, do you really own your computer? Absolutely not. It is depressing. - July 18th 2021

I looked into this further, all 32 bit support is removed on Windows 11, not just for the processor itself, but for any 32 bit sofware. I am really glad I finally switched to Linux over a year ago, as I remember my games I had were 32 bit only. Things like this make me regret it less and less each day, there wasn't much to regret anyways. Although, it is time for the industry to move to x64 or x64_128, so this is actually a positive thing. It is still sad to see it go. - July 19th 2021

Microsoft actually listened to the community and removed the TPM 2.0 DRM cipher requirement. It is still over-specked (likely not a word, but you know what I mean) and not open source enough. 

No new thoughts, no new data - July 28th 2021 to August 12th 2021

I am really considering ending software support for Windows 11 if there is no way to use Windows 11 offline in the future (lets say 50 years from now (August 13th 2071) via a Virtual Machine. - August 13th 2021

There have been a ton of bad changes to GitHub lately, I feel like they might be connected to Microsofts development of Windows 11. Over 85% of the bad features that were added to GitHub during my time on GitHub have occurred in the past 2 months. I can see that performance on GitHub is getting much worse, now requiring 2 additional CPU cores on my laptop to edit large files, and so on, when it originally only required 1 (it now uses 3) it is just a theory though that Microsoft is doing this intentionally to benefit Windows 11. - August 14th 2021

Is Microsoft preventing the installation of LibreOffice to bolster preinstalled Microsoft Office? Probably not - August 19th 2021

**Extras:**

1. Update `SeansLifeArchive_Extras_OtherWindows` further when ready.

2. Update the original Windows NT image repo with more Windows 8 pictures when ready.

3. New BSoD and RSoD images and documentation available and ready to use, starting July 21st 2021

4. No other extras at the moment

##### IDE work

I did not create any new IDE projects today. - July 5th 2021

I continued work on the revival of the TalkScript project today, the project went stale for 12 months before I made a breakthrough and was able to continue its development. This was the only IDE work I did today, it wasn't the normal IDE work. - July 6th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects today - July 7th 2021 to July 15th 2021

I did a little bit of IDE work today, starting the foundation for the SNU Programming Tools Batchfile, Pug, and KiXtart IDE sets. - July 16th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 17th 2021 to July 18th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 19th 2021 <!-- The repository SafeT doesn't count, as it is not an IDE !-->

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 20th 2021 <!-- Again, the repository SafeT doesn't count, as it is not an IDE !-->

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 21st 2021 to August 15th 2021

I worked on 2 IDE projects today, as part of a set of goals started yesterday. - August 16th 2021

I worked on 7 IDE projects today, as part of a set of goals started 2 days ago. - August 17th 2021

##### GitHub pages

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

Today is day 13 of my usage of GitHub pages. The Internet went out during my prime time today, so I had to work offline. I made progress later on, finishing up 1 page, and beginning work on another. - July 4th 2021

Today is day 14 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did brief work today and started 2 new pages, but got burnt out for the night out of stress of an error I made recently regarding 3 snap packages being for the wrong environment (I needed to do /bots instead of /robotics) - July 5th 2021

Today is day 15 of my usage of GitHub pages. I created new pages today, but I am growing very tired of having to refresh the page and wait 3-28+ times just to switch to an organization to create a new page. - July 6th 2021

Today is day 16 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but didn't achieve all my goals. I am growing extremely tired of having to refresh the page and wait 3-28+ times just to switch to an organization to create a new page. It was at its worst today. I did some inspecting and found that in the background, GitHub is constantly returning a 502 error and is failing to load the last few kilobytes of the data packets required to display the organization list. I don't know how to fix this, this might be something only Microsoft can fix. I wasted over an hour with this issue today. - July 7th 2021

Today is day 17 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but didn't achieve all my goals. I still got a decent amount done, writing README files for over 2 hours. I had very little issue with creating new pages today, although I only created 1, so it doesn't count against yesterdays issue. - July 8th 2021

Today is day 18 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but reached a limit and couldn't do more work. I also ran low on time. GitHub was not difficult with me with changing users today, so it worked out fine. I created 3 new pages today, and worked on several. - July 9th 2021

Today is day 19 of my usage of GitHub pages. This was my main focus for most of the day today, and I did incredibly well. I didn't reach the 25 project limit, but I created 5 new pages, and worked on some other ones as well. - July 10th 2021

Today is day 20 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't do any work here today, as I was focusing on documenting snapcraft usage. - July 11th 2021

Today is day 21 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't do any work here today, as I was focusing on documenting snapcraft usage. - July 12th 2021

Today is day 22 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made minor progress today, working on 2 new sites, and completing a couple of them. Despite having so much time today, I wasn't able to do as much as I should have been able to do. - July 13th 2021

Today is day 23 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made minor progress again today, working on 2 new sites, and completing one of them. Despite having so much time today, I wasn't able to do as much as I should have been able to do. I am nearing 10% completion with the webpage creation process. - July 14th 2021

Today is day 24 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made good progress today, creating and finishing 3 new sites, and also finishing another one (4 in total) it is becoming a very easy process. I have the documentation methods nailed at this point. - July 15th 2021

Today is day 25 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not use GitHub pages today. I worked on other projects. Apparently, stuff I create on my organizations is included in my main repository counter, so today, I ended up exceeding 1,100 projects. - July 16th

Today is day 26 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not make any new pages or work on any, but I made some useful templates for future work. - July 17th 2021

Today is day 27 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not make any new pages or work on any today. - July 18th 2021

Today is day 28 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not make any new pages or work on any today. I am starting to grow disappointed in my lack of doing so. - July 19th 2021

Today is day 29 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made a significant comeback today, working on 7 different pages, creating 5 new pages, and finishing 4 pages. I found an effective strategy for creating pages that bypasses the account switching part of the work:

```
Effective page creating strategy:

Go to /github/seanpm2001/organizations
Visit the preferred organization
Make sure the template you want to use is forked there
Create a new repository via the organizations repo create button
Absolutely no delays, just start creating
```

I am still a bit disappointed in myself for not finishing the other 3 pages today. - July 20th 2021

Today is day 30 (exactly 1 month to date) of my usage of GitHub pages. I made minor progress today, finishing the 3 pages I didn't get to yesterday, and working on 4 snap projects to match the 7 pages I have worked on recently (3 pages didn't require a snap package) I might not be able to make progress tomorrow due to so many of my repository work slots being full. - July 21st 2021

Today is day 31 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't create any new pages or work on any, but I did create the improved V5 General template for GitHub pages useless, so you can't say I did nothing. - July 22nd 2021

Today is day 32 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't do any GitHub pages or GitHub pages related work today. - July 23rd 2021

Today is day 33 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did some brief GitHub pages work today, creating and finishing 1 new site for the Team8Collection project. - July 24th 2021

##### Organization work continued

No data available

#### Snapcraft

I have recently started to work on porting my projects to Snapcraft, as an extra install option. Really, the only problem with snapcraft is that the server end is proprietary, the rest of the format is open source. I am still very new to this, and I have no way to actually develop snap programs. I have just been filling out the applications for it.

As part of fearing the rising problem of software as a service, I am going to stop supporting snapcraft at the current degree. I am also going to lessen my support for services, and promote ownership of products. I am also going to start fighting planned obsolescence harder, as it is a real problem environmentally, and societally.

[Gizmodo link](https://gizmodo.com/in-2030-you-wont-own-any-gadgets-1847176540) I have other research to support this issue, but there are too many to list here. I will list the full problem below.

#### Phases of the year (2020)

<!-- This section is incomplete. !-->

For my first year of GitHub, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml
January: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
February: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
March: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
April: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
May: the start of seanpm2001/Joining GitHub
June: the very basics of Git, SNU replatforming
July: Getting comfortable with Git and GitHub, July 9th, dawn of the Linux era
August: The rise of git-image, commits en masse.
September: The start of GitHub organizations
October: Average month, code distancing, and the continuing rise of git-image projects
November: Mass archival, mass projects, and first (failed) submission work
December: Wrapping up the year and the rise of the project language file, Meadows going online
```

#### Phases of the year (2021)

For this year, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml
January: Year preparation
February: Degoogle 2021
March: Discussion and code distancing
April: The race to join 100 commits each era/untitled month

September: Coming soon
October: Coming soon
November: Coming soon
December: Coming soon
```

#### GitHub organizations

GitHub organization work finished on June 26th 2021. I have not resumed work in a few days.

Some work was done today, 4 new organizations were created. - July 13th 2021

Some work was done again today, I found a small flaw and fixed it. 1 new organization was created - July 14th 2021.

Work resumed again on July 16th 2021, but I didn't finish documenting it today, so I will have to wrap up tomorrow. - July 16th 2021

Worked resumed again today a few days late. I created 3 organizations and finished documenting it. - July 19th 2021

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 10,900 (10.9K) stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"""notice:"""

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is how you do so:

"""how"""

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

"""alternatively"""

# You can go to the projects menu and see the exact amount (if you have access, I haven't tested this with non-seanpm2001 accounts yet)

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from a couple weeks ago was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

Some other recent changes I don't like include:

* 1. Location cannot be customized in organizations or user profiles - June 22nd 2021

* 2. Task lists have circular progress bars now, instead of a rectangular one, with no way to change it back - June 23rd 2021

* 3. The hover text for the commit calendar is now too bloated - July 31st 2021 to August 1st 2021, still ongoing as of August 3rd 2021

* 4. GitHub organizations getting redesigned and losing functionality and look too compact (you can't see how long ago a project was modifed anymore, and you can only see 10 projects at a time, breaking the view, and the sorting options. It wasn't broken Microsoft, why did you bring out the sledgehammer? - This actually really upset me yesterday (August 3rd 2021) but I didn't mention it until today (August 5th 2021)

* 4.1 - Description from August 11th 2021: Crappy layout, no borders, harder to browse and navigate, clunky, not as good, not necessary

* 4.2 - Update: modification times were added back, this is good, but the layout is still bad, and needs an API change. - ~August 9th 2021

* 5. The editor now auto collapses and auto expands while editing files, instead of remaining fixed with a scrollbar - August 11th 2021

* 5.1 I am not used to it yet

* 6. The `Code` button shrunk and its icon was removed, thus the feature was de-emphasized, although functionality remains the same... for now. - August 11th 2021

**What is the 25 project limit**

* GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

I have decided to start listing things I like about GitHub, as I don't want a fully negative experience.

<!-- Make a list of all the things you like about GitHub !-->

* 1. I like the GitHub linguist and its color codes. Ruby in dark mode reminds me of a certain part of my childhood

* 2. There are some skeuomorphic/detailed elements, and it is not all flat and boring. It seems like new skeuomorphic elements are being added (as of July 14th 2021)

* 3. There is some unique dialogue when an error happens, such as "yowsa, thats a lot of files"

* 4. Linux, BSD, MacOS, and other non-Windows support is available, along with support for various browsers. It isn't locked into just Google Chrome, and the site follows WHATWG web standards

* 5. The community is a lot friendlier and more professional (at least 100x) when compared to that of a site like YouTube

* 6. The site does a good job at tracking problems and fixing them

* 7. The site implements the Git version control system well

* 8. README Indexes are really neat, I really liked when they were introduced.

* 9. The site has a dark mode, but the people at GitHub went the extra mile and kept light mode, and even added a dark mode that is slightly dimmed for people who prefer it

* 10. The animation at the homepage is pretty cool, although a bit CPU intensive on Linux (like most other things, as my current computer has a poor GPU)

* 11. The "Secret" username/username repository is a good feature

* 12. More entries coming soon

#### Summer vacation #1

Ended, back home. See past status updates for more info.

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today. - June 26th 2021

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files on Sunday, June 13th 2021, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

On Monday, June 15th 2021, I tested this trick for MediaWiki, which GitHub recognizes as WikiText. Here is the `.gitattributes` sample file used:

##### WikiText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.wiki linguist-detectable=true
*.wiki linguist-documentation=false
```

Also:

##### YAML Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.yml linguist-detectable=true
*.yml linguist-documentation=false
*.yaml linguist-detectable=true
*.yaml linguist-documentation=false
```

##### ReStructuredText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.rst linguist-detectable=true
*.rst linguist-documentation=false
```

##### WebVTT Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.vtt linguist-detectable=true
*.vtt linguist-documentation=false
```

##### KiXtart Gitattributes (unsuccessful)

```gitattributes
*.kix linguist-detectable=true
*.kix linguist-documentation=false
```

I have not tested any other languages, I am still trying to test .svg .gitattributes .gitignore and .txt

#### Giving ProtonMail a 2nd chance

I am still very upset with ProtonMail, but I have decided to give them a second chance today, and try to work through some issues via movements, and contacting the people at the lovely Switzerland office. I will get into contacts with ProtonMail, and learn this new mess of a UI.

As of August 20th 2021, I have not tried ProtonMail again since the last login. I am extremely disappointed, as I may have permanently lost contact with a friend due to this.

#### Maintainers

Currently, I am the only maintainer for my GitHub projects. I am looking for new maintainers at the moment. I can't do all this by myself.

I am really looking for maintainers. I will train you myself if needed, but I only want people who enjoy doing it/really want to do it.

Maintenance is needed on my projects. I will get each project ready for maintenance by you or someone else. Please _**@**_ me for the training course.

On June 21st 2021, I made a repository outlining the beginning of my maintainer guidelines. You can view it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Maintainers-info)

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 45+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today. - June 23rd 2021

The todo list has been getting scattered development, most easy and medium tasks are being done, but not large or immersive projects - June 26th 2021

#### Year In Review GitHub Year 1 progress

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I didn't make any progress on this goal today - July 3rd 2021

I haven't made progress on this in months. - July 14th 2021

I still did not catch up on MB/DDG image work today. - July 5th 2021

I caught up on MB/DDG image work tonight. I have been noticing a pattern of me falling behind on this, then catching up every 3 days. I would like to have it be a daily thing, but if it is normal for my mind and workload, this fine. - July 6th 2021

I did not catch up today, but I did add new data, relating to a theory I had on the possible existence of the original lifeforms of this planet (that they may still be alive, and what we could learn from them if we managed to explore the ocean and possibly find them) and also fishtank specifications. - July 7th 2021

I kept caught up on MB/DDG image work again today. I want to try and keep on top of this from now on for as long as I can (before possibly forgetting/running out of time) - August 17th 2021 to August 20th 2021

#### The future of TRM

Currently, my brand names have 3 layers

Ancient: TRM (2015-2018) (August 3rd 2021-present)

Medieval: Seanwallawalla (2015-2018) (partially: 2020-present)

Modern: Seanpm2001 (2020-present)

TRM has been mostly abandoned for several years, with the exception of the TRM brand being defined and documented in 2020, and 2021. It has mostly just been a TeamTDM ripoff, and hasn't been used seriously since 2018. I decided to change the acronym today (August 3rd 2021) from:

**T**he

I**r**on

**M**elon

(it has technically just been Tim this whole time)

to:

**T**he

**R**eal

**M**yrick

The name was recommended by my Dad, and is a reference to the metaphor [The Real McCoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_real_McCoy) the original acronym might be archived into the name T-TIM (Team: The Iron Melon)

#### Vexillology work

I have been planning this for a few days, but I now plan on hosting a mirror of the site FOTW.info which is one of the top Vexillology (study of flags) sites. Today, I decided it would be too cumbersome to do by hand every day/week/month, so I have started work on getting the project automated. There is still work to go on this.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Clean slate

Next clean slate is ready on September 1st 2021.

#### And finally...

Today was a better day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I was wearing down while putting the finishing touches on this status post. I can't go any further today unfortunately. I really want to do more.

#### Miscellaneous notes

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.

I am trying to burn this into my brain, as I forget sometimes when asked about my projects, which is:

"don't ever be afraid to be yourself, as being yourself is all of who you are"

and also:

"if you try to be someone you are not, you will be found out as a fraud in the future"

People don't usually forget this, but I need to give this advice to myself, as I sometimes forget it when asked about what my projects are and what they do.

These status posts are going to be shortened eventually, I am still figuring out how to do so in a clean manner.
