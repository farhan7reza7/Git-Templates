# WacOS Concept Update 3

This new release of WacOS improves on the foundation. New programming languages were used, and the documentation was increased. Some other notable new concepts include:

> * Different CPU architecture planned support (Intel x86, Intel x64, AMD x64, PowerPC x86, Motorola x16)

> * New theme manager script, change the theme of the system

> * New Apple DOS mode (A-DOS mode)

> * New embedded Wiki

**Version 3 is just a concept update. It is not yet functional.**

***

The project is far from complete, but the foundation is being laid day by day.
