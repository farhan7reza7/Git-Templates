Collaboration: what happens when I accept a pull request #21

***

###

This is an important question I have had for a while:

When someone becomes a collaborator on one of my repositories via a pull request, do they have infinite access to the project? Can files start getting deleted without my permission and without my control?

I want to open up more to collaboration, but this is a major setback for me. I don't want to wake up and have all my work deleted. Even if I can roll it back, I don't think it would be worth it, due to how many different repositories (1300+) and changes I would have to roll back.
