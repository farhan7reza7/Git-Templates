What I don't like about the 2021 December 9th GitHub update

The inability to see stargazers anymore (edit: it just got moved, it is still there, just more difficult to access)
The inability to see fork networks anymore (edit: it just got moved, it is still there, just more difficult to access)
The inability to see the exact number of stars anymore (insted, it just says 5k+)
The wasted space of the moving of the star button
The inability to see watchers anymore (edit: it just got moved, it is still there, just more difficult to access)
Lists being limited to 16 entries
Lists not updating
The swap of the star and fork buttons
The new graphics (they are a bit of an eyesore, it needs to be a slightly darker shade of yellow for the star button)
The buttons on the navbar not being lined up

You know what, this update sucks. I originally liked it until noticing how many problems were
