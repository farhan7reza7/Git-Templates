GitHub had an update today that I don't like very much. It was the 2021 December 9th update. I feel I need to work further on GitHubby to correct this.

**What I like about the 2021 December 9th GitHub update:**

1. Lists

**What I don't like about the 2021 December 9th GitHub update:**

1. The inability to see stargazers anymore (edit: it just got moved, it is still there, just more difficult to access)

2. The inability to see fork networks anymore (edit: it just got moved, it is still there, just more difficult to access)

3. The inability to see the exact number of stars anymore (instead, it just says 5k+)

4. The wasted space of the moving of the star button

5. The inability to see watchers anymore (edit: it just got moved, it is still there, just more difficult to access)

6. Lists being limited to 16 entries

7. Lists not updating

8. The swap of the star and fork buttons

9. The new graphics (they are a bit of an eyesore, it needs to be a slightly darker shade of yellow for the star button)

10. The buttons on the navbar not being lined up
