[Very small issue] iPhoneOS directory needs a rename to PhoneOS #2

***

This is a very small issue for perfectionism. For the Darwin/i directory, I created a unique file path sequence by separating the OS from iOS, the PadOS from iPadOS, but I made the mistake of not separating the PhoneOS from iPhoneOS.

When I get to it, I will delete the directory and re-upload it to fix this issue.
