staunch privacy activist

everyone should have the right to secrecy and privacy. Sometimes, privacy is just needed temporarily
I don't like being stared at. Having 8 security cameras is like having 8 people staring at you with their mouth wide open, and their eyes shot wide, live streaming you to the Internet with their phone simultaneously
I don't have much control over regulations in the current household, I oppose a lot of things, but can't do much
