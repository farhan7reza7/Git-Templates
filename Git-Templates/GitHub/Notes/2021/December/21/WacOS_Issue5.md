Classic Mac System One interface with CSS #5

Hi! I have implemented the classic system one UI a long time ago in pure HTML and CSS:

As said on the page, use it however you want, but mention the source if you do.

Thank you for your contribution! I have included it in the project. It is now visible under [BaSYS/1](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/tree/master/Basys/1/UI_Demo/Web/peterhil/) I included the credits and added additional credits in the source code. I will be closing this issue now, but you can still follow up if needed.
