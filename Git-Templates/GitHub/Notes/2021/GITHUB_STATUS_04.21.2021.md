### Status update: April 21st 2021

I had another good day with development today, but I started out with a feeling of brain tension. I finally got through my small to-do list, and now I have gathered new assignments for myself.

I created 2 new organizations today. I was going to make just 1, and keep it at 10/month, but I decided to go for an extra one, as I felt it was needed, and now I have a full 7x7 square of organizations.

I worked heavily on SNU today, but mostly did heavy work on other documentation.

I am going to bed earlier, so I am going to quit here. I have an appointment in the morning.

Today was a great day for development.
