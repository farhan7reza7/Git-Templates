### Status

#### Main

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

<!-- May take a vacation on June 18th or June 20th !-->

I had a difficult day today. I was sick with a stomach bug today, and got poor sleep due to it. I still managed to get everything I wanted to get done done today.

#### Linux 1 year anniversary

The 1 year anniversary of my laptop is in 2 days, on July 9th 2021. I will officially be a Linux desktop user for a full year, and I will have had this laptop for 1 year (although I haven't used it for a full year yet)

#### Laptop mouse issues arise again (started June 24th 2021)

#### Tribute to Dennis Ritchie

I did not work on the Tribute project to Dennis Ritchie today. Updates are waiting for his posthumous birthday on September 9th (the next occurence being September 9th 2021, in `64` days from today (July 6th 2021)

##### Computer crash

_Crashes before June 18th 2021 are not listed here._

**As part of a cleanup process on this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

I thought the Wi-Fi symbol just became glitched, but it wasn't an error, our Internet just failed, the whole city won't have Internet until about 8 pm, so I will have to work offline for 3 hours. So much for Spectrums "99.9% reliability" this isn't even the first time this year that the Internet has gone out here. No other problems today. - July 4th 2021

There was a small 6 second freeze today, but that was it - July 5th 2021

There were no new crashes today. I decided to reinstall GIMP so I could do some graphic design work. I am yet to see if this is going to cause problems. There was another small 6 second freeze today, but that was it. I am wondering if having music playing helps prevent the lag from crashing the system. It is better than Windows at least, because if it crashes, it is a bit more calm and will continue to play music up until the screen goes black, rather than scaring the s##t out of me when it starts loudly buzzing and flickering, and then crashing. - July 6th 2021

#### Windows 11

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries from June 16th 2021 to June 23rd 2021 have been removed. You can find them in older entries.**

Windows 11 released: **June 24th 2021**

My opinion on Windows 11 has shifted significantly based on the announcement, with a growing negative attitude towards it. My new concerns are:

1. The system requiring 4 gigabytes of RAM (not including applications)

2. The system requiring ~64 gigabytes of storage

3. The system requiring an Internet connection and Microsoft Account to install

4. No 32 bit support (this may be a problem for older computers as well, but we should already be moved on from 32 bit at this point, it has been 27 years since the first 64 bit general consumer system came out (Nintendo 64) and the first consumer Windows 64 bit desktop came out in 2005, so I don't consider this too bad)

I am negative towards all these, especially the 3rd entry. I feel like Windows 11 is getting far too bloated and the Internet requirement to install is really stupid, and may not be possible in countries where Internet connection is not good enough to download gigabytes of data. It also will make it much more difficult to get a Windows 11 virtual machine, which is needed for people who can't have a Windows device, similar to the problem where developers have to buy a Macbook to develop for Apple, you can't buy every single device to develop, it will make it too difficult. There was a reason why this was already so opposed on Windows 10. This might be a failing point for the system, Microsoft, you should take note in this, more people should point this out to them, as my voice alone is too small. Another thing I find ridiculous is the 4 gigabytes of RAM to run the operating system. Not everyone has a super powerful computer, I know people who only have 2 or less gigabytes of RAM and will not be able to get this, I have also had to warn everyone in my house about performance problems, as the Windows 10 devices in this house only have 4-6 gigabytes of RAM and already run the operating system very poorly, and will not be able to handle the update. Even with Linux, with over 8x less RAM usage than Windows 11 (with Ubuntu + GNOME, the most bloated Linux combination; I could get usage down to 256/512 megabytes if/when I switch to a lighter stack) I am struggling to run applications, even with 8 gigabytes of RAM. I don't see this going very well.

Finally, the storage requirement. Storage is getting cheaper, but this is still ridiculous for an operating system. When you compare Windows XP and Windows 11, it is obvious that bloat has gotten bad at warp speed (64 megabytes vs 4096 megabytes (RAM) 1.5 gigabytes vs 64 gigabytes (Storage, with some models requiring at least 1 terabyte of storage for some reason) 133 megahertz (1 core) vs 1 Gigahertz (2 cores) (CPU speed) 32 bit support vs no 32 bit support (CPU type)) - June 24th 2021

I forgot to mention this, but Windows 11 is still in beta, so some things can be changed. I don't have much hope in the RAM, CPU, or Storage usage problems being fixed, but I feel like if enough people bug, the issues with the Trusted Protections Module DRM problem and Internet connected install/Microsoft account issues can be fixed. - June 25th 2021

My thoughts remain the same, no new data - June 26th 2021

No new thoughts, no new data - June 27th 2021

None - June 28th 2021

For the people who still use Windows and did not like Cortana, I have good news for you! Cortana is not included by default. I didn't have much against Cortana, I never developed an opinion on it, I just know that a lot of people couldn't stand her compared to other voice assistants. - June 29th 2021

I found out that Internet Explorer is officially discontinued now, which is good news for web developers. I will still be developing support for Internet Explorer via the BrowserNose project (quick summary: the BrowserNose project is a library that emulates support for every version of every web browser with as little feature loss as possible, all the way down to WorldWideWeb/Nexus (the first web browser) ) - June 29th 2021

This security thing TPM 2.0 is really sticking, I feel less hopeful about it being changed. Something I also forgot to mention was the removal of legacy BIOs support in favor of UEFI. I don't know enough about this to comment, other than it being another thing that prevents older computers from using Windows 11. - June 29th 2021

No new data, no new thoughts - June 30th 2021

No new thoughts, I did get to one of my extra goals today - July 1st 2021

My opinion towards the GUI is changing from negative to positive, I feel like Fluent Design is not the worst possible thing, and is a step towards skeuomorphism, which would be great, as minimalism sucks. I can actually tell this system apart from other systems now, unlike tens of thousands of releases of various operating systems and desktop environments from 2011 onward. Seriously, iOS 7 and up and Android 7 and up are pretty much identical in so many ways that I can hardly tell them apart. What is the point in designing a system if it isn't unique or different from the rest? Go and change the default wallpaper, and it is almost impossible to tell them apart, other than extremely small differences. - July 2nd 2021

No new data - July 3rd 2021

No new data - July 4th 2021

Forcing users to get a 5 gigabyte OneDrive account isn't the best idea. Memory is really cheap nowadays, even in the expensive Solid State Drive format, I can get a terabyte of data for $300, which is 200x more than a OneDrive account. I could get a 10 terabyte external hard drive for less than $250 and have over 2000x more space than OneDrive and every one of its account offers. Cloud storage isn't for everyone. Has anyone seen the videos I am referencing, where OneDrive immediately re-opens when you close it - July 5th 2021

No new thoughts, no new data - July 6th 2021

No new thoughts, no new data - July 7th 2021

**Extras:**

1. None

2. No other extras at the moment

##### IDE work

I did not create any new IDE projects today. - July 5th 2021

I continued work on the revival of the TalkScript project today, the project went stale for 12 months before I made a breakthrough and was able to continue its development. This was the only IDE work I did today, it wasn't the normal IDE work. - July 6th 221

##### GitHub pages

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

Today is day 13 of my usage of GitHub pages. The Internet went out during my prime time today, so I had to work offline. I made progress later on, finishing up 1 page, and beginning work on another. - July 4th 2021

Today is day 14 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did brief work today and started 2 new pages, but got burnt out for the night out of stress of an error I made recently regarding 3 snap packages being for the wrong environment (I needed to do /bots instead of /robotics) - July 5th 2021

Today is day 15 of my usage of GitHub pages. I created new pages today, but I am growing very tired of having to refresh the page and wait 3-28+ times just to switch to an organization to create a new page. - July 6th 2021

Today is day 16 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but didn't achieve all my goals. I am growing extremely tired of having to refresh the page and wait 3-28+ times just to switch to an organization to create a new page. It was at its worst today. I did some inspecting and found that in the background, GitHub is constantly returning a 502 error and is failing to load the last few kilobytes of the data packets required to display the organization list. I don't know how to fix this, this might be something only Microsoft can fix. I wasted over an hour with this issue today. - July 7th 2021

Date of start: June 21st 2021 (day 1) July 7th 2021 (day 16)

##### Organization work continued

Hopefully it was noted to @ghost{#followers that I have not simply ended GitHub organization work, this is a permanent thing. I have plans for more organizations, but I have held them off until Monday and Wednesday due to time constraints.

#### Snapcraft

I have recently started to work on porting my projects to Snapcraft, as an extra install option. Really, the only problem with snapcraft is that the server end is proprietary, the rest of the format is open source. I am still very new to this, and I have no way to actually develop snap programs. I have just been filling out the applications for it.

#### Phases of the year (2020)

```

#### Compared to yesterday

Compared to yesterday, I spent a little bit less time playing games. - July 7th 2021

#### GitHub organizations

GitHub organization work finished on June 26th 2021. I briefly resumed yesterday for the creation of 3 new organizations, and will finish off the current batch tomorrow (Wednesday)

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 09,800 (09.8K) stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"""notice:"""

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is how you do so:

"""how"""

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

"""alternatively"""

# You can go to the projects menu and see the exact amount (if you have access, I haven't tested this with non-seanpm2001 accounts yet)

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from a couple weeks ago was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

Some other recent changes I don't like include:

* Location cannot be customized in organizations or user profiles - June 22nd 2021

* Task lists have circular progress bars now, instead of a rectangular one, with no way to change it back - June 23rd 2021

**What is the 25 project limit**

GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

#### Summer vacation #1

I am going on vacation on July 18th to June 20th 2021. I am still preparing for this vacation. Some things may be temporarily cut from my schedule. **update:** I am looking into it further, and I may stay behind for the vacation.

Update: the vacation has been delayed, as of June 16th 2021. It is still on hold as of June 26th 2021

Update 2: the vacation has been delayed until July 30th 2021, and I am still undecided - July 3rd 2021

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today. - June 26th 2021

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files on Sunday, June 13th 2021, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

On Monday, June 15th 2021, I tested this trick for MediaWiki, which GitHub recognizes as WikiText. Here is the `.gitattributes` sample file used:

##### WikiText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.wiki linguist-detectable=true
*.wiki linguist-documentation=false
```

Also:

##### YAML Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.yml linguist-detectable=true
*.yml linguist-documentation=false
*.yaml linguist-detectable=true
*.yaml linguist-documentation=false
```

##### ReStructuredText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.rst linguist-detectable=true
*.rst linguist-documentation=false
```

##### WebVTT Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.vtt linguist-detectable=true
*.vtt linguist-documentation=false
```

I have not tested any other languages, I am still trying to test .svg .gitattributes .gitignore and .txt

#### Giving ProtonMail a 2nd chance

I am still very upset with ProtonMail, but I have decided to give them a second chance today, and try to work through some issues via movements, and contacting the people at the lovely Switzerland office. I will get into contacts with ProtonMail, and learn this new mess of a UI.

As of July 7th 2021, I have not tried ProtonMail again since the last login. I am extremely disappointed, as I may have permanently lost contact with a friend due to this.

#### Socializing

**As part of a cleanup process on this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

No progress - July 4th 2021

Very minor progress - July 5th 2021

No progress - July 6th 2021

No progress - July 7th 2021

#### Maintainers

Currently, I am the only maintainer for my GitHub projects. I am looking for new maintainers at the moment. I can't do all this by myself.

I am really looking for maintainers. I will train you myself if needed, but I only want people who enjoy doing it/really want to do it.

Maintenance is needed on my projects. I will get each project ready for maintenance by you or someone else. Please _**@**_ me for the training course.

Today (June 21st 2021) I made a repository outlining the beginning of my maintainer guidelines. You can view it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Maintainers-info)

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 45+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today. - June 23rd 2021

The todo list has been getting scattered development, most easy and medium tasks are being done, but not large or immersive projects - June 26th 2021

#### Year In Review GitHub Year 1 progress

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I didn't make any progress on this goal today - July 3rd 2021

#### Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

I failed to catch up on MB/DDG work today - July 4th 2021

I still did not catch up on MB/DDG image work today. - July 5th 2021

I caught up on MB/DDG image work tonight. I have been noticing a pattern of me falling behind on this, then catching up every 3 days. I would like to have it be a daily thing, but if it is normal for my mind and workload, this fine. - July 6th 2021

I did not catch up today, but I did add new data, relating to a theory I had on the possible existence of the original lifeforms of this planet (that they may still be alive, and what we could learn from them if we managed to explore the ocean and possibly find them) and also fishtank specifications. - July 7th 2021

#### Vexillology work

I have been planning this for a few days, but I now plan on hosting a mirror of the site FOTW.info which is one of the top Vexillology (study of flags) sites. Today, I decided it would be too cumbersome to do by hand every day/week/month, so I have started work on getting the project automated. There is still work to go on this.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Clean slate

Next clean slate is ready on August 1st 2021.

#### And finally...

Today was a decent day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I was wearing down while putting the finishing touches on this status post. I can't go any further today unfortunately. I really want to do more.

#### Miscellaneous notes

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.

I am trying to burn this into my brain, as I forget sometimes when asked about my projects, which is:

"don't ever be afraid to be yourself, as being yourself is all of who you are"

and also:

"if you try to be someone you are not, you will be found out as a fraud in the future"

People don't usually forget this, but I need to give this advice to myself, as I sometimes forget it when asked about what my projects are and what they do.

These status posts are going to be shortened eventually, I am still figuring out how to do so in a clean manner.
