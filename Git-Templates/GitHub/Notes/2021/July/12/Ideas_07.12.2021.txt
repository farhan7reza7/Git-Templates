URLL file

Stands for: URL List

A shortcut file that contains multiple shortcuts

Very simple syntax, just copy and paste the links into the document, 1 link per line. It will ignore whitespace and find each link

You can also write the syntax similar to that of a regular URL file, but as a list. Both syntax modes are allowed

Opens like this:

[You have opened a list of URLs. Which one would you like to open first?]

<listing, all entries>

Once the first one is opened, the dialogue changes to:

[You have opened a list of URLs. Which one would you like to open next?]

<listing, still all entries, purple for ones opened>

File properties:

Default icon

Keep memory of opened links [on/off]

MIME type: Internet/URL List

GUI mode: QT/GTK/WIN64/Metal
