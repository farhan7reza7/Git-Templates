### Status

#### Main

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

<!-- May take a vacation on June 18th or June 20th !-->

I had a revolutionarily good day with development today, and had various issues with distraction today. I got a little bit of work done. I feel tomorrow will be even better, as I am going to bed earlier. I need some sleep, as I have been up for over 16 hours. I have been very witty and creative today, and made many, many improvements to various projects.

#### Tribute to Dennis Ritchie

I did not work on the Tribute project to Dennis Ritchie today. Updates are waiting for his posthumous birthday on September 9th

Still the case as of June 22nd 2021

#### Sleep issues

I had a poor nights sleep last night, but a really, really good day with development, one of my best days in weeks. Not commit wise, I am talking about massive, massive documentation improvements, planning, and GitHub pages work.

#### Degoogling

I am now going to further Degoogle, here are some recent notes:

I have been doing lots of switching between file services, I recently resettled on Google Drive, but due to Chromium sync and dominance, the unsafeness of this method, and the future of Google outside Google Chrome, I forced myself to regain control, and switched back to full SD card backups, with AndrOpen Office replacing Microsoft Word after a few months of problem. Despite the ad festation before I open the document, it is the only way and works fine afterwards with no ads, as I can't use Google, and I can't pay for Microsoft Office. It is the only OpenOffice fork I can find for Android, and I like the interface due to its early 2000s design

Tons of work

#### SDE Gyroscope

I started a new small project today, which is a gyroscope utility for the SDE environment. It will be highly customizable, and offer the ability to see a visualization of the gyroscope inside the device. It will be developed by others from this point onward, although I might make some changes from time to time - June 21st 2021.

#### Hard Drive Backup

I did a hard drive backup today, large data operations will continue after 11:00 pm EST, June 21st 2021. - June 21st 2021

##### SimZonns project

I did not work on the SimZonns project today - June 17th 2021

I made no progress on the specification for the ZSIM protocol. - June 17th 2021

I worked on the SimZonns project very briefly today, just dumping some binary data for reinstalling the googled SIM card security driver (so that I can begin degoogling it, not the zip file) - yesterday

I had some plans for the project today, but I didn't get to implementing them - June 20th 2021

Same as yesterday - June 21st 2021

##### NexxFetch

I did not work on the NexxFetch project today - June 21st 2021

##### Lithium shortage

I am still concerned about the worlds lithium shortage, there has to be a better material we haven't discovered use of yet. I would recommend looking at common metals or chemicals that are ranked higher than 34 in their commons.

No recent thought as of June 21st 2021

##### Touch Pets Dogs 2 Rewritten

I did not work on my Touch Pets Dogs 2 recreation project today, I didn't get to it - June 21st 2021

##### Computer crash

Crashes before June 18th 2021 are not listed here.

XORG crashed severely today - June 18th 2021

My computer did not crash today, although it got close. - June 19th 2021

XORG crashed severely again today with error13: `XORG crashed with SIGABRT in raise()` 20 screenshots of error log were taken, as for whatever reason, I can't copy the text, or get a panoramic screenshot. I fear future crashes much more now, it has had its month of grace and seems to be going downhill now. Today, I have ruled out my headphones as the cause - June 20th 2021

2 GNOME-shell crashes occurred today due to frequent file saving (force-of-habit `CTRL` + `S`) I would rather have these crashes any day over an XORG crash or a Kernel Panic. No other crashes occurred today - June 21st 2021

No crashes have been noted today, but I may have found the program that is causing all the problems, which is `snapd` I thought I complete;y purged it while re-installing my system, and I have noted that several apps have been auto-updating themselves without my permission, and may be causing instability. My main indicator was the Ubuntu Software store getting completely redone. I will have to look into this further, although this is why I wanted to use Fedora over Ubuntu originally. - June 22nd 2021
##### Focus

I had great focus today, until the sun had been set for over an hour - Still true: June 22nd 2021

#### Windows 11

<!-- June 16th 2021

I have recently been alerted to the existance of Windows 11. I always thought it was going to be a joke, I remember being the gullible person in the past searching for Windows 12 (circa 2016) and now it might just be a reality. So far, my opinion is not too good on Windows 11, although now noting that the taskbar can be resized, it is a bit better, but still not perfect. The system really looks more dumbed down than ChromiumOS. The main concern I have for this is there being an additional operating system I have to support now (the other 3 new ones this month were iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and MacOS 12. Windows 11 is being added to this list) Microsoft, is this scaring you? Is MacOS going to a higher version number scaring you? You don't need to be worried about these things. Version number wars are pointless. Common examples include Firefox and Chrome, canceling releases (Google) so that they can go up 1 version number faster, etc... I don't have a completely full opinion on Windows 11 yet, but I will support the operating system, but will do Windows 10 support first.

It was fun catching up on this leak. Here is a random paranoid thought:

oOoOoOoOoOoOo Nadella Nadella, Linux computer, one snap of my fingers, Windows 11 has been installed on your computer OoOoOoOuWuOoOoOo

Don't be gullible, Windows 11 will not automatically be installed on your Linux machine. There would be a massive array of lawsuits that could kill a company if they tried.

!-->

I have been looking into Windows 11. I am still forming an opinion. It will take a while for me to form a compact opinion on it, but I can now announce I will be supporting it. - June 17th 2021

No new thoughts on Windows 11 today - June 18th 2021

No new thoughts on Windows 11 today - June 19th 2021

I have found that since Windows 11 contains some open source components, it is not a fully proprietary operating system anymore. I am really happy about this, as this is progress. Now, all of the mainstream popular operating systems are not fully proprietary, and open source usage just continues to grow. I feel like these changes will help with the growth of open source as a whole. Kudos to you, Microsoft, although I am still hoping for much more Linux growth, which does not include Windows Subsystem for Linux. - June 20th 2021

```python
Win11_support = bool(true) # I now support Windows 11
```

No new thoughts on Windows 11 today - June 22nd 2021

##### IDE work

I did not create any new IDE projects today. - June 22nd 2021

##### GitHub pages

I tested out GitHub pages today, as I had a website project I have been working on developing (I have so many website projects, I don't know how I didn't think of creating a personal one yet) I deployed it with GitHub pages, and felt like I opened a new realm of opportunity, like opening Pandoras Box. There is so much I can do with this. Although there are some limitations I currently don't like too much, the whole purpose of this plan that I have been developing was to have it hosted on a Linux home server and have files I can't store on GitHub (specifically files over 25 mebibytes in size) I completely overlooked this, and the fact that I have to rewrite the website in markdown (I think I will just transition to HTML) I am going to have to have an additional public file server alongside this. - June 21st 2021

One very small thing that I like but also annoys me a bit is that after every commit, it does 2 checks. I like that it is doing this, but at the same time, I don't want to have GitHub do so much extra work for my small commits, and also not create a copy of the pages every time I make a change. - June 21st 2021

- JUne 21st 2021

Today, I began an all out revolution with the usage of GitHub pages, setting up base camps, testing, and learning the very very basics. I accomplished a lot today. I now know to have 2 branches at all times, make pull requests more common, etc. I can't go into much more detail, I am very tired.

#### Compared to yesterday

Compared to yesterday, I spent a lot less time playing games.

#### This insanity

I have dealt with a lot of scheduling insanity lately due to the gaming system mixing with the 2021 organization system part A. It has really screwed up my schedule, and I am still waiting for the end of this process. Tomorrow should be better, but due to this being at its worst today, I came up with many creative ideas, but couldn't properly wrap up GitHub work for the day, and had to do some things out of order.

#### GitHub organizations

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 090.100% done, but not too close to being complete done. It is still expected to take up to June 22nd 2021 or longer. More data was added onto the pile yesterday, and it is now expected to take until June2 4th or later, but this may go up and down due to possible duplication. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- Today, I found an organization that wasn't listed, one of the 3 I have been trying to find, completely by accident. There are 2 more to find, but it might be difficult. I hope I just get lucky 1-2 more times, if not, I will continue to search. !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

#### Robotics month

Despite the "mandatory" robotics project this month, I made no progress publicly on TuxBot, but behind the scenes, I have been rebuilding the concept. I haven't worked on the project at all for a week now - June 21st 2021

<!--
I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 9,000 (9.0K) stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"notice:"

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is hoow you do so

"how"

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from a couple weeks ago was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

**What is the 25 project limit**

GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

#### Summer vacation #1

I am going on vacation on July 18th to June 20th 2021. I am still preparing for this vacation. Some things may be temporarily cut from my schedule. **update:** I am looking into it further, and I may stay behind for the vacation.

Update: the vacation has been delayed, as of June 16th 2021. It is still on hold as of June 21st 2021

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today. - June 21st 2021

<!--

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files yesterday, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

Today, I tested this trick for MediaWiki, which GitHub recognizes as WikiText. Here is the `.gitattributes` sample file used:

##### WikiText

```gitattributes
*.wiki linguist-detectable=true
*.wiki linguist-documentation=false
```

!-->

#### Giving ProtonMail a 2nd chance

I am still very upset with ProtonMail, but I have decided to give them a second chance today, and try to work through some issues via movements, and contacting the people at the lovely Switzerland office. I will get into contacts with ProtonMail, and learn this new mess of a UI.

As of June 21st 2021, I have not tried ProtonMail again since the last login.

#### Socializing

Walla Walla is pretty well vaccinated, but I am going to continue wearing a mask at all times when out in public, as being outside isn't an exception to me. I must wear it at all times. With that out of the way, I am working on socializing skills, and getting help for my projects. I plan on going to some Colleges I haven't been to since 3rd grade and try to find some help.

I made no progress on this goal today. - June 21st 2021

#### Maintainers

Currently, I am the only maintainer for my GitHub projects. I am looking for new maintainers at the moment. I can't do all this by myself.

I am really looking for maintainers. I will train you myself if needed, but I only want people who enjoy doing it/really want to do it.

Maintenance is needed on my projects. I will get each project ready for maintenance by you or someone else. Please _**@**_ me for the training course.

Today (June 21st 2021) I made a repository outlining the beginning of my maintainer guidelines. You can view it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Maintainers-info)

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 36+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today. - June 21st 2021

#### Year In Review GitHub Year 1 progress

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I didn't make any progress on this goal today - June 21st 2021

#### Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo

<!-- I did not have the time to update Marine Biology data and DuckDuckGo image data today. - Date ##th 2021 !-->

I had the time to do Marine Biology work, and DuckDuckGo image data upload work today. I would have taken a free day tonight if the data was still on the drives, but it wasn't only there, it was also on my laptop (copiessssss) - June 21st 2021.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I actually managed to not have the time to do marine biology and DuckDuckGo work today. I didn't have the time yesterday (Friday, June 11th 2021) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- TODO: TIMER, HELLO_WORLD.COFFEE, IMAGES.GENERAL :TODO !-->

#### And finally...

Today was a revolutionarily good day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I was wearing down while putting the finishing touches on this status post.

#### Miscellaneous notes

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.
