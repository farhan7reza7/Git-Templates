### Status

#### Main

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK
!-->

[See my year in review for Year 1 (May 25th 2020 to May 25th 2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!--TODO KEEP THIS SECTION TODO KEEP SECTION !-->

<!-- May take a vacation on June 18th or June 20th !-->

I had a surreal day with development, I was a bit sedated today, and I didn't do any organization work, as I finally finished the project. I did lots of work on `README` documentation, and GitHub pages work. The return to normal will finalize soon, it won't finish today. I did have some time taken out due to time spent playing games and researching random things. I got a lot done today.

#### Laptop mouse issues arise again (started June 24th 2021)

2 days ago (Thursday, June 24th 2021) my laptops mouse started acting up again, which is extremely upsetting. I am determined to fix it this time, and when I get a fix ready, I will go and fix my other laptop as well.

I have failed to report that there has been tons of minor graphicals bugs with this laptop, but not as bad as the last one, I am looking into the issue either being something with a video driver, the touchpad itself {sensitivity, settings} the mouse driver, or something else. I have not attempted to reinstall the mouse drivers yet, as I don't want to take that step yet (I have not yet tried `modprobe -r psmouse` or `modprobe psmouse -r` I forgot how to write the command as well, I forgot if pipes are placed to the left or the right) new notes: it seems that this problem is common for some people when the system is too overwhelmed, although not normal, and that it also might be a possible bug with the Linux kernel 5.0 to 5.3, although I have a more updated Kernel, so the bug might have persisted. Some people also achieved success by increasing the swap file to 8 gigabytes, but I don't want to do that unless I am absolutely sure.

For now, I will have to deal with it until I can resolve the problem. I have lived with this before, I can live with this again, easily. It will just be extremely inconvenient any annoying.

The issue has not recurred for over 73 hours, as of Sunday, June 27th 2021 at 11:14 pm.

See more below.

#### Tribute to Dennis Ritchie

I did not work on the Tribute project to Dennis Ritchie today. Updates are waiting for his posthumous birthday on September 9th (the next occurence being September 9th 2021, in `73` days from today (June 27th 2021)

Still the case as of June 27th 2021

##### SimZonns project

I did not work on the SimZonns project today - June 17th 2021

I made no progress on the specification for the ZSIM protocol. - June 17th 2021

I worked on the SimZonns project very briefly today, just dumping some binary data for reinstalling the googled SIM card security driver (so that I can begin degoogling it, not the zip file) - yesterday

I had some plans for the project today, but I didn't get to implementing them - June 20th 2021

Same as of recently - June 27th 2021

##### NexxFetch

I did not work on the NexxFetch project today - June 21st 2021

Same as of recently - June 27th 2021

##### Computer crash

Crashes before June 18th 2021 are not listed here.

XORG crashed severely today - June 18th 2021

My computer did not crash today, although it got close. - June 19th 2021

XORG crashed severely again today with error13: `XORG crashed with SIGABRT in raise()` 20 screenshots of error log were taken, as for whatever reason, I can't copy the text, or get a panoramic screenshot. I fear future crashes much more now, it has had its month of grace and seems to be going downhill now. Today, I have ruled out my headphones as the cause - June 20th 2021

2 GNOME-shell crashes occurred today due to frequent file saving (force-of-habit `CTRL` + `S`) I would rather have these crashes any day over an XORG crash or a Kernel Panic. No other crashes occurred today - June 21st 2021

No crashes have been noted today, but I may have found the program that is causing all the problems, which is `snapd` I thought I complete;y purged it while re-installing my system, and I have noted that several apps have been auto-updating themselves without my permission, and may be causing instability. My main indicator was the Ubuntu Software store getting completely redone. I will have to look into this further, although this is why I wanted to use Fedora over Ubuntu originally. - June 22nd 2021

No crashes occurred today, not even a minor one. The Ubuntu software store has reverted back to how it originally was, but I am still skeptical that `snapd` is causing some dependency failures - June 23rd 2021

**Critical** - Laptop cursor is having severe problems again, 1 temporary mouse crash today late in the evening, fixed with :terminal: -> gnome-tweaks - June 24th 2021

No mouse issues today, although when I figure this out, I just remembered this morning that I have an entire repository dedicated to this issue, and I will post my solutions there. I have also re-processed and now have all my strategies from last time ready for use again. - June 25th 2021

No technical issues today - June 26th 2021

The cursor issue has not returned yet, but Gedit crashed for the first time across my entire nearly first year of using Linux on the desktop. I was able to successfully recreate the small portion of unsaved data. - June 27th 2021

##### Focus

I had great focus today, until the sun had been set for over an hour - Still true: June 27th 2021

#### Windows 11

<!-- June 16th 2021

I have recently been alerted to the existance of Windows 11. I always thought it was going to be a joke, I remember being the gullible person in the past searching for Windows 12 (circa 2016) and now it might just be a reality. So far, my opinion is not too good on Windows 11, although now noting that the taskbar can be resized, it is a bit better, but still not perfect. The system really looks more dumbed down than ChromiumOS. The main concern I have for this is there being an additional operating system I have to support now (the other 3 new ones this month were iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and MacOS 12. Windows 11 is being added to this list) Microsoft, is this scaring you? Is MacOS going to a higher version number scaring you? You don't need to be worried about these things. Version number wars are pointless. Common examples include Firefox and Chrome, canceling releases (Google) so that they can go up 1 version number faster, etc... I don't have a completely full opinion on Windows 11 yet, but I will support the operating system, but will do Windows 10 support first.

It was fun catching up on this leak. Here is a random paranoid thought:

oOoOoOoOoOoOo Nadella Nadella, Linux computer, one snap of my fingers, Windows 11 has been installed on your computer OoOoOoOuWuOoOoOo

Don't be gullible, Windows 11 will not automatically be installed on your Linux machine. There would be a massive array of lawsuits that could kill a company if they tried.

!-->

I have been looking into Windows 11. I am still forming an opinion. It will take a while for me to form a compact opinion on it, but I can now announce I will be supporting it. - June 17th 2021

No new thoughts on Windows 11 today - June 18th 2021

No new thoughts on Windows 11 today - June 19th 2021

I have found that since Windows 11 contains some open source components, it is not a fully proprietary operating system anymore. I am really happy about this, as this is progress. Now, all of the mainstream popular operating systems are not fully proprietary, and open source usage just continues to grow. I feel like these changes will help with the growth of open source as a whole. Kudos to you, Microsoft, although I am still hoping for much more Linux growth, which does not include Windows Subsystem for Linux. - June 20th 2021

```python
Win11_support = bool(true) # I now support Windows 11
```

No new thoughts on Windows 11 today - June 22nd 2021

No new thoughts on Windows 11 today - June 23rd 2021

Windows 11 released: **June 24th 2021**

My opinion on Windows 11 has shifted significantly based on the announcement, with a growing negative attitude towards it. My new concerns are:

1. The system requiring 4 gigabytes of RAM (not including applications)

2. The system requiring ~64 gigabytes of storage

3. The system requiring an Internet connection and Microsoft Account to install

4. No 32 bit support (this may be a problem for older computers as well, but we should already be moved on from 32 bit at this point, it has been 27 years since the first 64 bit general consumer system came out (Nintendo 64) and the first consumer Windows 64 bit desktop came out in 2005, so I don't consider this too bad)

I am negative towards all these, especially the 3rd entry. I feel like Windows 11 is getting far too bloated and the Internet requirement to install is really stupid, and may not be possible in countries where Internet connection is not good enough to download gigabytes of data. It also will make it much more difficult to get a Windows 11 virtual machine, which is needed for people who can't have a Windows device, similar to the problem where developers have to buy a Macbook to develop for Apple, you can't buy every single device to develop, it will make it too difficult. There was a reason why this was already so opposed on Windows 10. This might be a failing point for the system, Microsoft, you should take note in this, more people should point this out to them, as my voice alone is too small. Another thing I find ridiculous is the 4 gigabytes of RAM to run the operating system. Not everyone has a super powerful computer, I know people who only have 2 or less gigabytes of RAM and will not be able to get this, I have also had to warn everyone in my house about performance problems, as the Windows 10 devices in this house only have 4-6 gigabytes of RAM and already run the operating system very poorly, and will not be able to handle the update. Even with Linux, with over 8x less RAM usage than Windows 11 (with Ubuntu + GNOME, the most bloated Linux combination; I could get usage down to 256/512 megabytes if/when I switch to a lighter stack) I am struggling to run applications, even with 8 gigabytes of RAM. I don't see this going very well.

Finally, the storage requirement. Storage is getting cheaper, but this is still ridiculous for an operating system. When you compare Windows XP and Windows 11, it is obvious that bloat has gotten bad at warp speed (64 megabytes vs 4096 megabytes (RAM) 1.5 gigabytes vs 64 gigabytes (Storage, with some models requiring at least 1 terabyte of storage for some reason) 133 megahertz (1 core) vs 1 Gigahertz (2 cores) (CPU speed) 32 bit support vs no 32 bit support (CPU type)) - June 24th 2021

I forgot to mention this, but Windows 11 is still in beta, so some things can be changed. I don't have much hope in the RAM, CPU, or Storage usage problems being fixed, but I feel like if enough people bug, the issues with the Trusted Protections Module DRM problem and Internet connected install/Microsoft account issues can be fixed. - June 25th 2021

My thoughts remain the same, no new data - June 26th 2021

No new thoughts, no new data - June 27th 2021

**Extras:**

1. Should I upload Windows 11 media in its own separate repo, or start a new WindowsImage project?

2. No other extras at the moment

##### IDE work

I did not create any new IDE projects today. - June 27th 2021

##### GitHub pages

Today is day 6 of my GitHub pages revolution, <!-- I made no progress today, and I forgot to mention that I started using new templates yesterday. !--> I made minor progress today and did some more usual GitHub pages work. There is still a lot to go before I am caught up, I don't have an end goal in sight right now either.

Date of start: June 21st 2021

#### Phases of the year (2020)

<!-- This section is incomplete. !-->

For my first year of GitHub, these are the phases I have gone through:

```

#### Compared to yesterday

Compared to yesterday, I spent a lot more time playing games.

#### GitHub organizations

GitHub organization work finished on June 26th 2021. No new data for today.

#### Robotics month

Despite the "mandatory" robotics project this month, I made no progress publicly on TuxBot, but behind the scenes, I have been rebuilding the concept. I haven't worked on the project at all for a week now - June 21st 2021

I made minor progress today, but only for work on the new website - June 25th 2021

No progress on the project was made at all today - June 26th 2021

No new progress was made on the project today - JUne 27th 2021

<!--
I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 09,400 (09.4K) stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"""notice:"""

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is how you do so:

"""how"""

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

"""alternatively"""

# You can go to the projects menu and see the exact amount (if you have access, I haven't tested this with non-seanpm2001 accounts yet)

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from a couple weeks ago was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

Some other recent changes I don't like include:

* Location cannot be customized in organizations or user profiles - June 22nd 2021

* Task lists have circular progress bars now, instead of a rectangular one, with no way to change it back - June 23rd 2021

**What is the 25 project limit**

GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

#### Summer vacation #1

I am going on vacation on July 18th to June 20th 2021. I am still preparing for this vacation. Some things may be temporarily cut from my schedule. **update:** I am looking into it further, and I may stay behind for the vacation.

Update: the vacation has been delayed, as of June 16th 2021. It is still on hold as of June 26th 2021

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today. - June 26th 2021

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files on <dateHere>, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

On <datehere>, I tested this trick for MediaWiki, which GitHub recognizes as WikiText. Here is the `.gitattributes` sample file used:

##### WikiText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.wiki linguist-detectable=true
*.wiki linguist-documentation=false
```

Also:

##### YAML Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.yml linguist-detectable=true
*.yml linguist-documentation=false
*.yaml linguist-detectable=true
*.yaml linguist-documentation=false
```

##### ReStructuredText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.rst linguist-detectable=true
*.rst linguist-documentation=false
```

#### Giving ProtonMail a 2nd chance

I am still very upset with ProtonMail, but I have decided to give them a second chance today, and try to work through some issues via movements, and contacting the people at the lovely Switzerland office. I will get into contacts with ProtonMail, and learn this new mess of a UI.

As of June 27th 2021, I have not tried ProtonMail again since the last login.

#### Socializing

Walla Walla is pretty well vaccinated, but I am going to continue wearing a mask at all times when out in public, as being outside isn't an exception to me. I must wear it at all times. With that out of the way, I am working on socializing skills, and getting help for my projects. I plan on going to some Colleges I haven't been to since 3rd grade and try to find some help.

I made no progress on this goal today. - June 24th 2021

I made some progress on this goal today, I am trying to find a research lab/computer lab to visit though. I wanted to visit a College, but I can't unless I enroll, which I don't want to do. - June 25th 2021

No progress was made today - June 26th 2021

No progress was made again today - June 27th 2021

#### Maintainers

Currently, I am the only maintainer for my GitHub projects. I am looking for new maintainers at the moment. I can't do all this by myself.

I am really looking for maintainers. I will train you myself if needed, but I only want people who enjoy doing it/really want to do it.

Maintenance is needed on my projects. I will get each project ready for maintenance by you or someone else. Please _**@**_ me for the training course.

Today (June 21st 2021) I made a repository outlining the beginning of my maintainer guidelines. You can view it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Maintainers-info)

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 45+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today. - June 23rd 2021

The todo list has been getting scattered development, most easy and medium tasks are being done, but not large or immersive projects - June 26th 2021

#### Year In Review GitHub Year 1 progress

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I didn't make any progress on this goal today - June 27th 2021

#### Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo

<!-- I did not have the time to update Marine Biology data and DuckDuckGo image data today. - Date ##th 2021 !-->

I had the time to do Marine Biology work, and DuckDuckGo image data upload work today. - June 22nd 2021.

I did not have the time to do MB & DDG work today - June 23rd 2021

I really wanted to do DuckDuckGo and Marine Biology work today to get a full 25 projects worked on, but there were some technical issues (mouth) and not enough time (off by a couple munutes) - June 24th 2021

<!-- (>template<) (>response<) !--> I got caught up on Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo image work today. - June 25th 2021

I failed to catch up on Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo work tonight. - June 26th 2021.

I successfully caught up on Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo image work tonight - June 27th 2021

#### Vexillology work

I have been planning this for a few days, but I now plan on hosting a mirror of the site FOTW.info which is one of the top Vexillology (study of flags) sites. Today, I decided it would be too cumbersome to do by hand every day/week/month, so I have started work on getting the project automated. There is still work to go on this.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- I did not publish my status post on the day again today. !-->

<!-- TODO: TIMER, HELLO_WORLD.COFFEE, IMAGES.GENERAL :TODO !-->

#### And finally...

Today was a very good day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I was wearing down while putting the finishing touches on this status post.

#### Miscellaneous notes

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.

I am trying to burn this into my brain, as I forget sometimes when asked about my projects, which is:

"don't ever be afraid to be yourself, as being yourself is all of who you are"

and also:

"if you try to be someone you are not, you will be found out as a fraud in the future"

People don't usually forget this, but I need to give this advice to myself, as I sometimes forget it when asked about what my projects are and what they do.
