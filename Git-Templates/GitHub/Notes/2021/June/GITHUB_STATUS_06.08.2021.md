I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

I had a very good/very mild day with development today, and a significantly better day personally. I am doing a lot better today, but I didn't get to my robotics goal, but made it to several other goals.

For this year, these are the phases I have gone through

```yaml
January: Year preparation
February: Degoogle 2021
March: Discussion and code distancing
April: The race to join 100 commits each era/untitled month
May: GitHub platform month, organization documentation and creation celebration and acceleration
June: Robotics month, and GitHub organization documentation finalization, and Gist revival
July: Coming soon
August: Coming soon
September: Coming soon
October: Coming soon
November: Coming soon
December: Coming soon
```

Compared to yesterday, I spent a lot less time playing games, as I enjoyed playing, just not as much today

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 62.3% done, but not too close to being complete done. It is still expected to take up to June 22nd 2021 or longer. More data was added onto the pile yesterday, and it is now expected to take until June 22nd or later, but this may go up and down due to possible duplication. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I focused on the robotics project a little further today, writing controls for the land mode. I seem to have failed all research for this project, as I am just now finding out penguins are slow, but can go up to 100 miles per hour while swimming. So a new waterproof model is in the works, and another redesign is in progress. It still got attention this month out of the mandatory Robotic June event.

I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 7.8K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

I am going on vacation on July 18th to June 20th 2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I got very minor progress made with this today, but only for brand new data I rediscovetred.

I had some motivation and focus issues today. It may have been caused by me not getting a full 8 hours of sleep last night.

I spent 2 hours sorting files today, I love my new organized system a lot. I had difficulty making progress in various projects, and I was on a continuum of ups and downs. I did some note work today, and resumed Gist updates and their archival. 

I have more new plans for work, and 32+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier. To

I have been working off a todo list today, i managed to cut it down today, but also add to it.

I started a project regarding military ethics in my programming, it isn't generic, I will go through with it tomorrow.

On a day with so much time, I expected more to get done. I can't not tell myself this, but I did well today. I even solved one of my biggest worries, that in itself should have made this a tremendous day. I solved the storage crisis #1 (1 Yottabyte = 100 billion users with 100 terabytes of data each)

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got some work done on the Year in Review project, GitHub is no longer giving me scoped data for the past year before May 31st 2021, so now I have all the images ready. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I forgot to do marine biology work today and couldn't due to little time left. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- TODO: TIMER, HELLO_WORLD.COFFEE, IMAGES.GENERAL :TODO !-->

Today was a decent day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->
