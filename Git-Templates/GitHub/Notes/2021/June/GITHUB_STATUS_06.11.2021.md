I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

<!-- May take a vacation on June 18th or June 20th !-->

I had a very productive but extremely difficult day today due to a protein deficiency. I got a lot done today, and almost had to take some work off in the end, due to health problems. Today, I reached 1000 repositories. My 1000th repository was a mausoleum tour guide software. 6 other projects were created, which were very minor projects that just define my Linux desktop build. I did spend more time on them than I'd like to admit (at least 2 hours total)

I found a new restriction on GitHub today, apparently GitHub truncates nearly everything by 1000, as I can't get all my repository data now in a list. I am hoping I don't have to download projects I am worried about just to see how much they take up.

For this year, these are the phases I have gone through

```yaml
January: Year preparation
February: Degoogle 2021
March: Discussion and code distancing
April: The race to join 100 commits each era/untitled month
May: GitHub platform month, organization documentation and creation celebration and acceleration
June: Robotics month, and GitHub organization documentation finalization, and Gist revival
July: Coming soon
August: Coming soon
September: Coming soon
October: Coming soon
November: Coming soon
December: Coming soon
```

Compared to yesterday, I spent a lot more time playing games, as I enjoyed playing.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 68.4% done, but not too close to being complete done. It is still expected to take up to June 22nd 2021 or longer. More data was added onto the pile yesterday, and it is now expected to take until June 23rd or later, but this may go up and down due to possible duplication. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- Today, I found an organization that wasn't listed, one of the 3 I have been trying to find, completely by accident. There are 2 more to find, but it might be difficult. I hope I just get lucky 1-2 more times, if not, I will continue to search. !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I finally updated my food index today, some more crucial updates will need to be made later regarding the protein situation, but I finally made a nutritionist report review today, after holding it off due to laziness/busyness.

Despite the mandatory robotics project this month, I made no progress publicly on TuxBot, but behind the scenes, I have been rebuilding the concept.

<!--
I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 8.2K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

Today, I reached 1000 repositories. I went up to 1006 to end the day. I skipped DuckDuckGo and Marine Biology work today due to time and health reasons. I am suffering at my own demise.

```python
"notice:"

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is hoow you do so

"how"

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

```

I worked on my Linux desktop structure project further today, which contains separate repositories that act as a mirror of certain UNIX directories (such as `/home` `/Downloads` `/Documents` etc. I would have gone further with this today, but I maxed out at 25 repositories for the day.

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from this week was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't loom good.

**What is the 25 project limit**

GitHUb only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

I created an account for Price Computers LLC today, and have been using it to promote my projects for now. I won't go too far with this, but if they request it, I will wipe the account, and hand ownership over.

I am going on vacation on July 18th to June 20th 2021. I am still preparing for this vacation. Some things may be temporarily cut from my schedule. **update:** I am looking into it further, and I may stay behind for the vacation.

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I got very minor progress made with this today, but only for brand new data I rediscovered.

I have more new plans for work, and 31+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I managed to cut it down today, but also add to it.

On a day with so much time, I expected more to get done. I can't not tell myself this, but I did well today.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got some work done on the Year in Review project, GitHub is no longer giving me scoped data for the past year before May 31st 2021, so now I have all the images ready. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I managed to have the time to do marine biology and DuckDuckGo work today. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- TODO: TIMER, HELLO_WORLD.COFFEE, IMAGES.GENERAL :TODO !-->

Today was a very good day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->
