### Status

#### Main

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK
!-->

[See my year in review for Year 1 (May 25th 2020 to May 25th 2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!--TODO KEEP THIS SECTION TODO KEEP SECTION !-->

<!-- May take a vacation on June 18th or June 20th !-->

I had a less productive day, but was still somewhat productive. I was doing a lot better health wise today. I was unfoused today, and didn't get too much done.

#### Phases of the year (2021)

For this year, these are the phases I have gone through

```yaml
January: Year preparation
February: Degoogle 2021
March: Discussion and code distancing
April: The race to join 100 commits each era/untitled month
May: GitHub platform month, organization documentation and creation celebration and acceleration
June: Robotics month, and GitHub organization documentation finalization, and Gist revival
July: Coming soon
August: Coming soon
September: Coming soon
October: Coming soon
November: Coming soon
December: Coming soon
```

#### Compared to yesterday

Compared to yesterday, I spent a lot more time playing games, as I enjoyed playing.

#### GitHub organizations

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 68.4% done, but not too close to being complete done. It is still expected to take up to June 22nd 2021 or longer. More data was added onto the pile yesterday, and it is now expected to take until June 23rd or later, but this may go up and down due to possible duplication. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- Today, I found an organization that wasn't listed, one of the 3 I have been trying to find, completely by accident. There are 2 more to find, but it might be difficult. I hope I just get lucky 1-2 more times, if not, I will continue to search. !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

#### Robotics month

Despite the mandatory robotics project this month, I made no progress publicly on TuxBot, but behind the scenes, I have been rebuilding the concept.

<!--
I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 8.3K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"notice:"

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is hoow you do so

"how"

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from this week was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

**What is the 25 project limit**

GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

#### ProtomMail issues

I recently gained back access to my ProtonMail account, after being locked out due to an error. I truly hate the re-design. It also impaired the functionality and made it unusable. I don't have the time to delete 2300+ spam GitHub emails per day (I set myself up on this by watching every project I star) but now my trick of putting everything from GitHub automatically in spam and then clearing the trash doesn't work, as the empty trash option was removed, and I can't go through and delete 550 pages of emails every day 50 at a time. I will no longer be using ProtonMail, I wanted the privacy, but now the functionality is gone. I currently have no options for email.

#### New opinion on Bing translate

I have been finding Bing translate to be better since I last checked it, I am hoping I can partially phase out Google translate with it, and eventually fully transition from Google translate, but the language support isn't as good.

#### Summer vacation #1

I am going on vacation on July 18th to June 20th 2021. I am still preparing for this vacation. Some things may be temporarily cut from my schedule. **update:** I am looking into it further, and I may stay behind for the vacation.

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today.

#### Video database update June 12th 2021

I briefly got my video database sorted and up to date publicly and privately today. It is now up to date. I will need to do some more downloads to replenish my supply.

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 34+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I actually managed to have the time to do marine biology and DuckDuckGo work today. I didn't have the time yesterday (Friday, June 11th 2021) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- TODO: TIMER, HELLO_WORLD.COFFEE, IMAGES.GENERAL :TODO !-->

#### And finally...

Today was a very good day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files.
