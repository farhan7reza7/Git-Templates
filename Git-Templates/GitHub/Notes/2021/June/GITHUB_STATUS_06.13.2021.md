### Status

#### Main

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK
!-->

<!--TODO KEEP THIS SECTION TODO KEEP SECTION !-->

<!-- May take a vacation on June 18th or June 20th !-->

I had a productive day today, but had minor difficulties in the end. I added an additional 0.4 days to the organization goal, thus adding an additional day. I learned something new with Git today, and worked on various projects. I got sidetasked a lot today.

#### Phases of the year (2020)

<!-- This section is incomplete. !-->

For my first year of GitHub, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml

June: the very basics of Git, SNU replatforming
July: Getting comfortable with Git and GitHub

September: The start of GitHub organizations
October: Average month, code distancing, and the continuing rise of git-image projects
November: Mass archival, mass projects, and first (failed) submission work
December: Wrapping up the year and the rise of the project language file, Meadows going online
```

#### Phases of the year (2021)

For this year, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml

```

#### Compared to yesterday

Compared to yesterday, I spent slightly less time playing games.

#### GitHub organizations

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 75.0% done, but not too close to being complete done. It is still expected to take up to June 22nd 2021 or longer. More data was added onto the pile yesterday, and it is now expected to take until June 23rd or later, but this may go up and down due to possible duplication. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- Today, I found an organization that wasn't listed, one of the 3 I have been trying to find, completely by accident. There are 2 more to find, but it might be difficult. I hope I just get lucky 1-2 more times, if not, I will continue to search. !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

#### Robotics month

Despite the mandatory robotics project this month, I made no progress publicly on TuxBot, but behind the scenes, I have been rebuilding the concept.

<!--
I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 8.4K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"notice:"

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is hoow you do so

"how"

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from this week was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

**What is the 25 project limit**

GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

#### Summer vacation #1

I am going on vacation on July 18th to June 20th 2021. I am still preparing for this vacation. Some things may be temporarily cut from my schedule. **update:** I am looking into it further, and I may stay behind for the vacation.

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today.

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files today, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

##### YAML

```gitattributes
*.yml linguist-detectable=true
*.yaml linguist-detectable=true
```

It isn't the most useful feature, but it did help increase development on my Markdown and YAML IDE projects.

#### Project 1001

I finalized the decision for a new project today known as project 1001, or project 1k1/1k01. Its goal is to aide users in blocking truncation on websites, heavily inspired by GitHub truncating anything with over 6, 25, or 1000 entries (depending on what content you are viewing) I have defined the idea officially today, and currently it only has 1 subproject, which I should probably update soon.

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 34+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today.

#### Count Mausoleum

I made some progress on my Mausoleum project tonight in getting it further ready.

#### Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo

I did not have the time to update Marine Biology data and DuckDuckGo image data today.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I actually managed to have the time to do marine biology and DuckDuckGo work today. I didn't have the time yesterday (Friday, June 11th 2021) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- TODO: TIMER, HELLO_WORLD.COFFEE, IMAGES.GENERAL :TODO !-->

#### And finally...

Today was a very good day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.
