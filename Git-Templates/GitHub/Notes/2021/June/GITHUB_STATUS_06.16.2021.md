### Status

#### Main

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

<!-- May take a vacation on June 18th or June 20th !-->

I had a productive day today, but had minor difficulties in the middle of the evening, and late at night.

##### SimZonns project

I got some work done on the the SimZonns project today, adding new research articles, and planned experimental support for Apple SIM. I added my first set of certified SIM Card drivers to the project.

I made no progress on the specification for the ZSIM protocol.

##### NexxFetch

I started a new project known as Nexxfetch. I feel the name is more unique with 2 Xs, although I am worried that GitHub itself had a bad impression on the projects use of 2 x's, as it temporarily disabled my sponsor button for this project only.

The project aims to be the Neofetch of the web browser.

#### Windows 11

I have recently been alerted to the existance of Windows 11. I always thought it was going to be a joke, I remember being the gullible person in the past searching for Windows 12 (circa 2016) and now it might just be a reality. So far, my opinion is not too good on Windows 11, although now noting that the taskbar can be resized, it is a bit better, but still not perfect. The system really looks more dumbed down than ChromiumOS. The main concern I have for this is there being an additional operating system I have to support now (the other 3 new ones this month were iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and MacOS 12. Windows 11 is being added to this list) Microsoft, is this scaring you? Is MacOS going to a higher version number scaring you? You don't need to be worried about these things. Version number wars are pointless. Common examples include Firefox and Chrome, canceling releases (Google) so that they can go up 1 version number faster, etc... I don't have a completely full opinion on Windows 11 yet, but I will support the operating system, but will do Windows 10 support first.

It was fun catching up on this leak. Here is a random paranoid thought:

oOoOoOoOoOoOo Nadella Nadella, Linux computer, one snap of my fingers, Windows 11 has been installed on your computer OoOoOoOuWuOoOoOo

Don't be gullible, Windows 11 will not automatically be installed on your Linux machine. There would be a massive array of lawsuits that could kill a company if they tried.

##### IDE work

I created 1 new SNU IDE project tonight that have been held off for a while. I created an IDE for BibTeX

#### Compared to yesterday

Compared to yesterday, I spent a lot more time playing games.

#### GitHub organizations

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 084.998% done, but not too close to being complete done. It is still expected to take up to June 22nd 2021 or longer. More data was added onto the pile yesterday, and it is now expected to take until June 23rd or later, but this may go up and down due to possible duplication. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- Today, I found an organization that wasn't listed, one of the 3 I have been trying to find, completely by accident. There are 2 more to find, but it might be difficult. I hope I just get lucky 1-2 more times, if not, I will continue to search. !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

#### Robotics month

Despite the mandatory robotics project this month, I made no progress publicly on TuxBot, but behind the scenes, I have been rebuilding the concept.

<!--
I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 8.5K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"notice:"

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is hoow you do so

"how"

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from this week was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

**What is the 25 project limit**

GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

#### Summer vacation #1

I am going on vacation on July 18th to June 20th 2021. I am still preparing for this vacation. Some things may be temporarily cut from my schedule. **update:** I am looking into it further, and I may stay behind for the vacation.

Update: the vacation has been delayed, as of June 16th 2021.

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today.

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files yesterday, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

Today, I tested this trick for MediaWiki, which GitHub recognizes as WikiText. Here is the `.gitattributes` sample file used:

##### WikiText

```gitattributes
*.wiki linguist-detectable=true
*.wiki linguist-documentation=false
```

#### Giving ProtonMail a 2nd chance

I am still very upset with ProtonMail, but I have decided to give them a second chance today, and try to work through some issues via movements, and contacting the people at the lovely Switzerland office. I will get into contacts with ProtonMail, and learn this new mess of a UI.

#### Socializing

Walla Walla is pretty well vaccinated, but I am going to continue wearing a mask at all times when out in public, as being outside isn't an exception to me. I must wear it at all times. With that out of the way, I am working on socializing skills, and getting help for my projects. I plan on going to some Colleges I haven't been to since 3rd grade and try to find some help.

#### Maintainers

Currently, I am the only maintainter for my GitHub projects. I am looking for new maintainers at the moment. I can't do all this by myself.

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 36+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today.

#### Year In Review GitHub Year 1 progress

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo

<!-- I did not have the time to update Marine Biology data and DuckDuckGo image data today. !-->

I had the the time to do Marine Biology data work and DuckDuckGo image work today.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I actually managed to have the time to do marine biology and DuckDuckGo work today. I didn't have the time yesterday (Friday, June 11th 2021) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- TODO: TIMER, HELLO_WORLD.COFFEE, IMAGES.GENERAL :TODO !-->

#### And finally...

Today was a very good day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Miscellaneous notes

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.
