### Status

#### Main

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

I had an unproductive day today, and had various issues with distraction today. I got a little bit of work done.

#### Tribute to Dennis Ritchie

I did not work on the Tribute project to Dennis Ritchie today. Updates are waiting for his posthumous birthday on September 9th

##### SimZonns project

I did not work on the SimZonns project today - June 17th 2021

I made no progress on the specification for the ZSIM protocol. - June 17th 2021

I worked on the SimZonns project very briefly today, just dumping some binary data for reinstalling the googled SIM card security driver (so that I can begin degoogling it, not the zip file)

##### NexxFetch

I did not work on the NexxFetch project today - June 18th 2021

##### Lithium shortage

Lately, I have been working on the blueprints for my super computer laptop, and I have come to note a dangerous shortage on Lithium, mostly due to Tesla car batteries.

I have become really concerned, as with the ~billions of iPhones being dumped into landfills, the next Samsung Galaxy throw your old phone in the dumpster FE, and the likes, I fear we may run out of Lithium and will need a new way to make batteries.

My possible solutions:

* Experiment with recycling and reusing Lithium, take a landfill, melt it down, and start producing 2nd generation Lithium batteries (I am hoping this is scientifically possible) I really hope for this, as I want to revolutionize recycling, and lower/end the slavery in the Republic of the Congo

* Experiment with a Silicon or other common metal battery (I am hoping this is scientifically possible)

I have been stressed out, as I am working on a redesingn of thr super power laptop. The new redesign features an $800 200,000 MaH battery (or 200 GaH) it will likely be just 10 separate 20 GaH batteries.

##### Touch Pets Dogs 2 Rewritten

I worked further on my Touch Pets Dogs 2 recreation project today, as I had some nostalgia, and wanted to revive the project. I am looking for people who have played in the past that may want to develop it or test-develop it.

I have enough graphics and screenshots to successfully recreate the game. I am just not a good programmer yet, and can only write CLI programs (unless I use HTML, Scratch, QML, or markdown) amnd I don't have the capacity to make a 3D game. There is so much that goes into it. I am hoping that this game can be recreated.

##### Computer crash

I dealt with a major XORG computer crash today, I have been handling computer crashes better and better over time, today I handled it the best. I had no panic, no screaming, and no fear. I handled it extremely well, and I recreated the 2 files that got lost.

##### Focus

Throughout most of the day, I had laser focus, and got lots done as the clock ticked away. I had a focus crash starting after 9:00 pm. I was in a rush ever since, and had a difficult time with my schedule.

#### Windows 11

<!-- June 16th 2021

I have recently been alerted to the existance of Windows 11. I always thought it was going to be a joke, I remember being the gullible person in the past searching for Windows 12 (circa 2016) and now it might just be a reality. So far, my opinion is not too good on Windows 11, although now noting that the taskbar can be resized, it is a bit better, but still not perfect. The system really looks more dumbed down than ChromiumOS. The main concern I have for this is there being an additional operating system I have to support now (the other 3 new ones this month were iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and MacOS 12. Windows 11 is being added to this list) Microsoft, is this scaring you? Is MacOS going to a higher version number scaring you? You don't need to be worried about these things. Version number wars are pointless. Common examples include Firefox and Chrome, canceling releases (Google) so that they can go up 1 version number faster, etc... I don't have a completely full opinion on Windows 11 yet, but I will support the operating system, but will do Windows 10 support first.

It was fun catching up on this leak. Here is a random paranoid thought:

oOoOoOoOoOoOo Nadella Nadella, Linux computer, one snap of my fingers, Windows 11 has been installed on your computer OoOoOoOuWuOoOoOo

Don't be gullible, Windows 11 will not automatically be installed on your Linux machine. There would be a massive array of lawsuits that could kill a company if they tried.

!-->

I have been looking into Windows 11. I am still forming an opinion. It will take a while for me to form a compact opinion on it, but I can now announce I will be supporting it. - June 17th 2021

No new thoughts on Windows 11 today - JUne 18th 2021

```python
Win11_support = bool(true) # I now support Windows 11
```

##### IDE work

I created 2 new IDEs today, one for the J programming language, and 1 for the Nix programming language. - June 18th 2021

#### Compared to yesterday

Compared to yesterday, I spent less time playing games.

#### GitHub organizations

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 090.100% done, but not too close to being complete done. It is still expected to take up to June 22nd 2021 or longer. More data was added onto the pile yesterday, and it is now expected to take until June2 4th or later, but this may go up and down due to possible duplication. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- Today, I found an organization that wasn't listed, one of the 3 I have been trying to find, completely by accident. There are 2 more to find, but it might be difficult. I hope I just get lucky 1-2 more times, if not, I will continue to search. !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

#### Robotics month

Despite the mandatory robotics project this month, I made no progress publicly on TuxBot, but behind the scenes, I have been rebuilding the concept.

<!--
I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 8.8K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"notice:"

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is hoow you do so

"how"

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from last week was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

**What is the 25 project limit**

GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

#### Summer vacation #1

I am going on vacation on July 18th to June 20th 2021. I am still preparing for this vacation. Some things may be temporarily cut from my schedule. **update:** I am looking into it further, and I may stay behind for the vacation.

Update: the vacation has been delayed, as of June 16th 2021. It is still on hold as of June 18th 2021

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today. - June 18th 2021

<!--

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files yesterday, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

Today, I tested this trick for MediaWiki, which GitHub recognizes as WikiText. Here is the `.gitattributes` sample file used:

##### WikiText

```gitattributes
*.wiki linguist-detectable=true
*.wiki linguist-documentation=false
```

!-->

#### Giving ProtonMail a 2nd chance

I am still very upset with ProtonMail, but I have decided to give them a second chance today, and try to work through some issues via movements, and contacting the people at the lovely Switzerland office. I will get into contacts with ProtonMail, and learn this new mess of a UI.

As of June 18th 2021, I have not tried ProtonMail again since the last login.

#### Socializing

Walla Walla is pretty well vaccinated, but I am going to continue wearing a mask at all times when out in public, as being outside isn't an exception to me. I must wear it at all times. With that out of the way, I am working on socializing skills, and getting help for my projects. I plan on going to some Colleges I haven't been to since 3rd grade and try to find some help.

I made no progress on this goal today. - June 18th 2021

#### Maintainers

Currently, I am the only maintainer for my GitHub projects. I am looking for new maintainers at the moment. I can't do all this by myself.

I am really looking for maintainers. I will train you myself if needed, but I only want people who enjoy doing it/really want to do it.

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 36+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today.

#### Year In Review GitHub Year 1 progress

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo

<!-- I did not have the time to update Marine Biology data and DuckDuckGo image data today. !-->

I did not have the the time to do Marine Biology data work and DuckDuckGo image work today. I didn't have time for most other projects today either. I wanted to have time, but everything fell apart tonight - June 18th 2021

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I actually managed to not have the time to do marine biology and DuckDuckGo work today. I didn't have the time yesterday (Friday, June 11th 2021) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- TODO: TIMER, HELLO_WORLD.COFFEE, IMAGES.GENERAL :TODO !-->

#### And finally...

Today was a very good day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Miscellaneous notes

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.
