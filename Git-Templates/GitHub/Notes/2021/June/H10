This is an advertisement, I am not affiliated with Letscom, but I highly recommend their usage

Pros:

1. Hi-Fi (High Fidelity audio)

2. 100 hour battery (for my own usage, I only have to charge them once a month)

3. They contain a built-in microphone

4. Only $20.00, cheaper and more functional than a $100 to $300 pair from Bose or Dr. Dre

5. Headphones are highly durable and flexible, just don't sit on them (they will break, they aren't a Nokia 3310)

6. Headphones are Bluetooth

7. Headphones meet all my needs

Here are the cons, none of them apply to me, but may apply to you

1. They are not earphones

2. If you are using Linux, overamplification doesn't work well (it doesn't work well in general yet, even without headphones) and you may hear a lot of statistics
