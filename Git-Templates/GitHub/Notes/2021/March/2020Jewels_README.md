# My 2020 Jewels experience

This directory contains my Jewels gameplay pictures from 2020.

Images from 2020 are done on a daily basis from September 10th 2020 to December 31st 2020.

I started getting these screenshots daily on September 10th 2020. 

It turned into a daily tradition from this point onward, up until I retired the device on January 18th 2021.
