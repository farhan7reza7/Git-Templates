# My 2021 Jewels experience

This directory contains my Jewels gameplay pictures from 2021.

Images from 2021 are done on a daily basis from January 1st 2021 to January 18th 2021. As of January 18th 2021, I quit playing the game on a daily basis due to my device failing.

I started getting these screenshots daily on September 10th 2020. 

It turned into a daily tradition from this point onward, up until I retired the device on January 18th 2021.
