  For the maintainers, here are some tips 💡 for getting started with Discussions. We'll leave these in Markdown comments for now, but feel free to take out the comments for all maintainers to see.

  📢 **Announce to your community** that Discussions is available! Go ahead and send that tweet, post, or link it from the website to drive traffic here.

  🔗 If you use issue templates, **link any relevant issue templates** such as questions and community conversations to Discussions. Declutter your issues by driving community content to where they belong in Discussions. If you need help, here's a [link to the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser).

  ➡️ You can **convert issues to discussions** either individually or bulk by labels. Looking at you, issues labeled “question” or “discussion”.

### Upload error - October 2nd 2020 data uploaded to the wrong directory

I uploaded the October 2nd 2020 data to the wrong directory. I realized after I uploaded most of the files, and at that point, I decided to just continue uploading. To clarify, this was the October 2nd folder within the **September** 2020 directory. If anyone knows how to mass move binary files without deletion or individual uploads, it would be helpful to know.

### [Upload error] Data for other game accidentally updated (January 6th 2021)

I accidentally uploaded Sky Burger data for 1 entry for January 6th 2021 by mistake. I was distracted while doing this. This folder needs deletion, but I don't know how to mass-delete files in Git, and I don't want to make 100 separate commits of deleting files if there is an easier way.
