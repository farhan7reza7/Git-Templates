### Status update: March 1st 2021

I forgot to mention this on the main thread, but there has been some progress with these daily status posts in the past month. First off, it has now become a routine. I no longer hold it off for 1-6 days, I post updates daily, and I haven't forgotten in weeks. I even keep files of the posts, so that details are in higher quality.

Today was a very slow day for me. I didn't get too much done, but I prepared some of the monthly tasks for some projects. I spent a lot of time gaming today in the morning, but much more time sorting my laptops files. I have fallen in love with the /public/ directory, and I have been optimizing it as much as I can, as I plan on turning it into a network server. Right now, it is an easy access hub for files I normally don't have access to. I have never made my computer this organized before. My downloads folder only has 4 entries, and the desktop only has 13 entries. Some folders were completely cleaned out. A little mishap also happened in the sorting process, where I had 11 videos selected, and I accidentally opened them all at once (it didn't even feel like I pressed the left click button, or the enter button) it immediately froze my computer, and I struggled to close all VLC tabs. I saved my session with 700 megabytes of SWAP left and recreated my playlist (which only had 3 entries before the crash)

I struggled to start my journal today. I eventually forced myself to get started on it, so I could continue other work. I am not looking forward to tomorrow in terms of productivity, as a game that has caused me many productivity issues is now a monthly game that is played on the first Tuesday of each month (Idle Miner Tycoon) luckily it is only this week. I still enjoy the game, but it takes a lot of time.

Today I also reached 100 followers on GitHub. I have a fresh slate of progress today, as it is a new month.

Today was a decent day for development.
