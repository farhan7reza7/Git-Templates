### Status update: March 22nd 2021

I continued to do further work on the process of enabling sponsor buttons today, but didn't do much else. There is a lot to go on this, and I hope to make a lot of progress by Thursday. My days have been long lately, but at the same time, they have felt pretty dull, and it has felt like there isn't enough time in the day.

Today, during my gaming session, I came across an extremely disgusting ad targeted towards children, and it triggered multiple phobias for me, and was the most vile, disgusting ad that has ever been served to be. My gaming session still lasted over 5 hours today, which really affected my time. This shouldn't be an issue for the next 2-3 days/possible 2-4 days.

I was in a rush to get work done by midnight again tonight. Last night, I forgot to get cellular/mobile Khan Academy screenshots until after midnight. The mobile screenshots are just a different format of the desktop screenshots, which were taken same day. I don't know how this will affect the legitimacy of the day of the data.

Today was an OK day for development.
