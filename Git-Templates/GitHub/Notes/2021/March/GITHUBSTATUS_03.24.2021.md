### Status update: March 24th 2021

Today I didn't do as much work on the sponsor info and GitHub folder work, but I did do heavy work on my data pack archive system. I am also planning for my new laptop and doing the usual tasks. I was a bit slow several times today and unmotivated at times. I have been a little bit sick today.

I was in a rush to finish things up tonight, and I am hoping the screenshots I get of my end of day progress aren't overshadowed by issues that happened today regarding GitHub commits.

GitHub was acting up a little bit early today, my commit counts weren't updating. My 12750 commit screenshot was 7 off due to an error, I may have forgotten to take a 12800 commit screenshot, and my 12900 commit screenshot was off by 6 commits. I also had a error today, but I forgot to minimize my open tab first. It was an uncensored version of a song I got yesterday, with the very few swear words that were bleeped out. I didn't even notice the swear words in the uncensored version, and there were only 3 that were censored. It is pretty ironic that this happened due to the song being about censorship by the FCC and controversies. Nobody seems to have reported this issue enough or GitHub isn't documenting it. It is incredibly annoying, and has demotivated me a lot, and made some data projects more difficult.

I got some smaller tasks done today, and made progress on getting the GitHub folder ready on as many projects as possible. I now have ways of simplifying the process, and I enjoy doing it.

I got some programming work done today via project language files, and tinkered around with some languages to try and learn parts of them. I still haven't gotten back to work on ProTraApp, Code-distancing, or NostalgiaProject yet.

Today was a good day for development.
