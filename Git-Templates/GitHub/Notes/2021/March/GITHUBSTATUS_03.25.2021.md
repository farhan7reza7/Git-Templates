### Status update: March 25th 2021

Today was a long day, and I got a lot done. I fixed the issue on GitHub. If you are having a similar issue, try my method if you already haven't: clean out the email inbox associated with your GitHub account if it is completely full.

I cleared out my email and deleted over 26000 spam emails (ProtonMail is slow for me, and it took over 5 hours to delete the 26000+ spam emails. I don't know why I am having this problem) as my account was at `500.00 MB/500.00 MB`

Another annoying GitHub bug went away today as well, the `double dark mode` bug is longer present for me: (light mode -> dark mode -> light mode + refresh = dark mode -> light mode + refresh = light mode)

I had a virtual meeting this morning, and I found out about a meeting in April. It is on a Sunday, so it shouldn't affect me too much. I got work done earlier on in a different order, but didn't get to several tasks.

I started doing further Marine Biology research today, as it is my new hobby again. I have caught up my knowledge base and confirmed all past knowledge, and learned a lot more today. I also got another daily video of the fish.

GitHub added a new feature today that I really love: a dropdown button for README files that give you an index of the file. As much as I love it, I am confused about something: why is it only showing up on specific projects, and not others? The process seems a bit random, and it seems to only be applying to half the files I have seen.

I was supposed to be updating the README file for my profile, but I unfortunately never got to it.

I mostly did documentation and image work today. I don't feel like I did enough.

Today was an OK day for development.
