### Status update: March 26th 2021

I had a gaming addiction problem today that took up a lot of my time. I worked part-time on several other goals and small projects, including re-doing my profile README to make it a easy, user-friendly portal to everything I have to offer on GitHub and more. I have been coming up with ideas for multiple days, and have been working on it.

I got my new keyboard protector on today. I did a lot of work on my profile README but don't feel ready to publish it yet. I was in a rush to shut down tonight, as I didn't want to keep going, and I was really tired.

Today was an ehhhh... day for development.
