### Status update: March 27th 2021

I had a better day today addiction-wise, but I still got sucked in a bit on both games. Today, I finally finished the V7 profile README update, but there were some errors noted afterwards (all links to different language articles were broken) so I will fix that tomorrow. This update took 3 days to make.

I have been considering the idea of a open source security camera lately. I don't like security cameras very much, especially proprietary ones, but they are useful in some cases. Due to an issue with a lack of knowledge on trustworthy, fully open-source security cameras, I decided to create an article project on the subject to promote them, as I don't want to put forward the resources to making my own security camera system, as it is not my thing.

I worked up late again tonight, possibly the last night I can do this for a while. My familys Hawaii vacation ends tomorrow, and they are coming back, so things should go back to normal for me hopefully.

Today was an OK day for development.
