### Status update: March 28th 2021

I have really been loving the new feature that was recently added to GitHub (the index button) it has caused a lot of inspiration. Today, it caused me to decide to make a status post for every day of playing games. This is a new set of data that started consecutively yesterday, but was confirmed to be a new routine today.

I had a long relaxing morning and early afternoon. My parents came back from Hawaii today.

<!-- Notes: I have come to really love the GitHub README index button, and I have been doing more for projects because of it. It has also helped me start making daily game descriptions on how I play, among other things !-->

I didn't get as much done as I wanted to today, but I got some things done. I did a mass-forking session, making progress towards my organization project system. THe big new thing from today was the daily documentation on everyting.

Today was an OK day for development.
