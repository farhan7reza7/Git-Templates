### Status update: March 29th 2021

I had a pretty good day with development today. On the other hand, my laptop didn't have a very good day.

My laptops new screen protector is already flopping around, it is going to need more tape applied. Also, my laptop had Bluetooth and battery issues today. So it has had all possible hardware issues (that it has had in the past) today. I couldn't use my headphones to listen to music, and my battery took 1 hour and 15 minutes to go from 92% to 100%, just a bad battery reading, as it immediately dropped back down to 92% battery upon unplugging, although I really feel it was at 100%, as the battery was draining 8% slower and I was getting battery estimates over 2 hours higher than usual. All these issues are temporary and come up once every 1-8 months. It won't be a problem by April 1st (I hope it is over by April 1st, because the current data I have shows that this problem goes away after 2-3 days)

I got work done in several projects today (mostly image projects) and started 10 new image repositories, based on some notes. I still have 4 more repository ideas that I didn't get to today.

While researching COBOL today, I found that I like 1 aspect of the language, which is its heavily human (English) syntax. If it wasn't for the verbosity, I feel like there shouldn't be as much hate for its continued existance. I actually like it. I probably wouldn't write actual programs in it though, as it is just too old and too unsupported. It is good for image projects, basic projects, and IDEs that run COBOL though.

I wanted to go to bed earlier tonight, but I failed on this goal.

Today was an OK day for development.
