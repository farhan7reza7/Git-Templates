### Status update: March 30th 2021

I had a weirdly productive day today. There were times where I felt like I was going to get all the things I wanted done today, and there were times I didn't.

I currently have 3 projects queued: an update to the audioDB, an update to the videoDB, and fixing my profile README

I got a lot done today documentation wise, and started learning a bit about JavaScript in better detail, but I made really smelly source code. It reeks like a dumpster. _*BLEAUGH!*_

One of my new ideas out of the 15 was started today, and it is a bit controversial. It was an idea I came up with at random. It is a library and ad packet that gets connected via the ad system the site uses. The ad will detect the anti-adblock message and show a message saying to turn on your adblocker. If the user does so, the site will say to turn off their ad blocker, and the user will either go through a confused loop, or find a different site.

This idea is a bit controversial, but I am going to stick by it for now. It is my first official attempt at hacktivism. I plan on targetting sites that maliciously use ads and other sites that tell the user to turn their adblock off. For the people who do this, they feel that nothing comes before profit, not even the user. I might not fully go through with the idea.

I feel that I may have lost some followers due to this today.

I got a lot done today, and had much more time, but still didn't get everything done.

Last night, I discovered how to lock issues. I plan on doing this for my daily status posts from now on.

Today was an OK day for development.
