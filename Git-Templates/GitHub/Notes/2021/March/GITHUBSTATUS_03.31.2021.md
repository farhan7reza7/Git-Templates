### Status update: March 31st 2021

I had a good day with development today. I woke up really early and had more time than I had work that I was willing to do. I updated my GitHub profile README today and did an important update to fix the language links and add some new data. I also spent over 1 hour and 47 minutes translating the article into over 25 different languages.

My new backup laptop came today, and I got distracted with setting it up. It had some issues first thing, as I got a slightly different processor/some other issue, but I fixed it by fully updating the system. As usual for my Linux setups, I had to delete Chrome again. It was made very difficult, but I eventually got it wiped off my machine. I am going to enjoy this backup laptop. It is nearly identical to my current one when not counting hard drive contents. I plan on having half and half on 2 systems.

I did a code review on ruffle-rs again today. It has been over a month since doing so.

I got some new music today, and came across some nostalgic music. I hope that someday, the VLC note entries for each access to a song may take up more than the original file itself.

I stayed up really late tonight, I hope tomorrow goes well productivity wise. I have a non-traditional April Fools joke planned for tomorrow that I have been planning for a few days.

I had a really good month with development this month. Things really turned around, and I got a lot done. I made nearly 7200 contributions this month, which is my best overall for 2021 so far.

Today was a good day for development.
