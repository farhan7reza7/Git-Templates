# GitHub activity March 6th 2021

**The** `GitHub stars & follow` **file is receiving an expansion. Starting February 26th 2021, I am now keeping a log of all activities.**

## Forks

**Note:** forked repositories are starred by default, unless I say otherwise (3 examples from 1 repo: [Why-you-should-stop-using-Google-analytics](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Why-you-should-stop-using-Google-analytics) along with some other projects)

## Stars

https://github.com/dustinkirkland/hollywood - Something I found recently. A cool UNIX program that turns your Linux Terminal into a Hollywood hacker movie set so that you can hack the mainframe and collapse the Soviet Union in a trandimensional hyperspace (OK, bad example, that was a bit forced)

## Follows

Yesterday, I dropped from 100 to 99 followers. It was disappointing. The next day, my follower count increased by 5, now at 104 (as of 8:35 pm, it is up to 105) 3 of the followers were completely new. I hope to stay above 100 followers, and eventually have more interaction on my projects.

_Empty list, see below._
