# GitHub activity March 6th 2021

**The** `GitHub stars & follow` **file is receiving an expansion. Starting February 26th 2021, I am now keeping a log of all activities.**

## Forks

**Note:** forked repositories are starred by default, unless I say otherwise (3 examples from 1 repo: [Why-you-should-stop-using-Google-analytics](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Why-you-should-stop-using-Google-analytics) along with some other projects)

### Seanpm2001

<!--

**Note: 3 commits are ommitted from /seanpm2001/seanpm2001/ (2 commits) and /seanpm2001/Git-Templates/ (1 commit) as they are the end projects. Also, Git-Templates is where this is uploaded.**

_This rule is subject to change._

Data for yesterday (March 6th 2021) was not added, as I forgot. However, I feel like this is a good thing the next day, as I have a new plan: post data for yesterday instead of today. This way, all the commit data is given, and no commits are excluded.

I will still need to gather some commit data (for projects with 5 or less commits) for days where I feel like/will go above 25 different repositories being edited.
