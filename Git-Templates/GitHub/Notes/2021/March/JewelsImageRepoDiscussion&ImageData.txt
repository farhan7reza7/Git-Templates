### December 31st data uploaded incorrectly (and how to fix similar errors)

I accidentally uploaded the December 31st 2020 data to the root of the `2020` directory, instead of the root of the `!December` directory. I didn't realize until 7 commits (out of 8) in. I feel like this issue (and other similar issues) can be fixed with Git sub-modules, once I figure out how to set them up.

# Device retired (January 18th 2021)

I have now officially retired my old Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, and thus I have discontinued my Jewels session. The device is not operational enough to continue playing, as the power button required to take screenshots and power the device on is too difficult to press now, and no modern device supports the game. Unfortunately, I have now stopped playing. It is going to be a little difficult for me for a while, but I should get used to it. I still intend to play the game in an Android virtual machine in the future.

I may still make updates to this repository from time to time until then. Although, I am not returning to this game for a while.
