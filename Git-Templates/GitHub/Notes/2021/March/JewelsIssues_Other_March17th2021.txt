### Sorted data for September & October 2020 is needed

The September and October 2020 directories are currently empty, besides a README.md file. Data needs to be moved in here. Currently, I don't know how to mass-move files in Git, so this is another issue that can't be fixed until I figure out how to do so.

### December 2020 updates needed

The December 2020 directory has 2 issues:

These issues will need to get fixed eventually.
