  For the maintainers, here are some tips 💡 for getting started with Discussions. We'll leave these in Markdown comments for now, but feel free to take out the comments for all maintainers to see.

  📢 **Announce to your community** that Discussions is available! Go ahead and send that tweet, post, or link it from the website to drive traffic here.

  🔗 If you use issue templates, **link any relevant issue templates** such as questions and community conversations to Discussions. Declutter your issues by driving community content to where they belong in Discussions. If you need help, here's a [link to the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser).

  ➡️ You can **convert issues to discussions** either individually or bulk by labels. Looking at you, issues labeled “question” or “discussion”.

Feature request thread #4 

This project hasn't been updated since June 2020. A lot has changed in Minecraft since then, and I have been having difficulty gathering new blocks, items, entities, and other features to add. This thread is a place to post feature requests. Note that the feature doesn't have to be from Minecraft Java edition or Bedrock edition, it can also be from a mod, or from a new idea.

It's been a long time #5 

I am starting to work on getting back into the development on this project, but I feel bad for modifying it so much, as it is my first GitHub repository, and it has a lot of nostalgia tied to it.

This project is going to start receiving more updates soon. There is still a lot to be done here.
