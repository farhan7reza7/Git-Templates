# March 2021 Jewels progress

March 2021 is my second full consecutive month of not playing Jewels. I have left my old S7 edge plugged in, but haven't used it at all. I hardly check on it anymore. This repository lays dormant, other than an update I made on March 17th 2021 to modernize it with recent standards.

I still miss the game.

## Some notes

1. I quit playing Jewels (for now) on January 18th 2021. I have not played since.
 
2. No other notes for this month
