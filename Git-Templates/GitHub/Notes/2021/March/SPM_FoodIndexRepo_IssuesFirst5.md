### Feature request: nutrional values for all entries + vegetarianism info

As the title says, but also: why I can't go Vegan, why I chose to go Vegetarian, historical idles who were vegan/vegetarian.

This update will take a lot of time, but won't be much work.

February 2021 issue report #7

### February 2021 issue report

I have reviewed the functionality of the site today, and noted many things that need to be fixed. I see that this project was a bit rushed when I made it, I built it in less than 12 hours, so that's probably why.

When I get to fixing it, here are the things that need to be fixed:

* Sidebar icon is broken

* Most image links are broken

* Many page links are broken

* Might need a white background option, due to the images with white backgrounds (slightly ambiguous, as I have still not yet figured out how to make buttons that change the page interface)

* Entry: spaghetti-Os needs to be removed, as it is no longer eaten at the moment

* Google sites mode interface option (ambiguous project) - will convert the site from basic HTML that can run on nearly any web browser to a recreation of the original Google Sites version, which will require Linux kernel 2.3/3.11 and up, Windows XP and up, MacOS X 10.0 and up, etc. Requires massive HTML, CSS, JS and graphical rewrite, estimated development time: ~80-200 hours. This will disclude all Google and tracking code.

CSV Data request #5

### CSV Data request

For this project, there should be a large CSV file that lists all the food and drinks (separately and all-in-one) listed in the project, so it can be searched more easily.

### Update needed for 2 items (November 2nd 2020)

This project hasn't had a new content update for new food items since 2018. There have recently been 2 items I have remembered that I liked in the past (Hamburger) and items I still like (Ritz cheese crackers) the database needs to be updated to include info on these 2 entries.

V2.02 - Categorial upload uploaded to the wrong directory #3

### V2.02 - Categorial upload uploaded to the wrong directory

I uploaded the HTML file work from October 20th 2020 to the wrong directory originally, and re-uploaded it. I don't know how to mass delete files automatically, but the issue isn't present in V2.03. I would like to fix 2.03
