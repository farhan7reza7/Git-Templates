External directory naming issue #1

### External directory naming issue

I wish I would have noticed this sooner, but the external directory is named `extermal` with an `m` instead of an `n` I won't fix this by myself, but I will allow contributions on a separate branch for anyone who wants to spend their time fixing it.
