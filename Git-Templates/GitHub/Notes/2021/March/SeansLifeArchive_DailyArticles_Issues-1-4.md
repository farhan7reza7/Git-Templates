### Incomplete: data for February 2017-December 2017 not yet added

The directory structure for February 2017 to December 2017 has not yet been added. It is going to take me time to add it. I am raising this issue to motivate myself to get it done faster. I will try to finish this goal within the next 11-22 days.

R1:

I am a little bit late to closing this. I didn't think I would finish so quickly. I originally was going to do it all manually on GitHub, but a little bit in, I found a much more efficient way, which was to create a copy, take out all the private and large files, add `IGNORE.md` files, and upload it to GitHub piece by piece. It reduced the time needed by over a week. Some documents may never be able to be added due to the GitHub 25 Megabyte file limit (there were some documents that were over 400 megabytes in size) anyway, I am closing this issue, as the problem has been resolved.

Journaling data not yet fully available #3 

***

### Journaling data not yet fully available

This journal project contains a lot of sensitive information, and a lot of documents over 25 megabytes in size (especially in 2017, and 2018) I have a planned full release date of May 15th 2040, if I die before this, I will have my successor release it all early. 

I am still deciding on which documents can be made public. There will be some documents going public eventually, but likely only ones that are older than 4 years.

Right now, I am working on building the structure for the documents, so that the journaling package can be emulated without all data, and later on, with all data.
