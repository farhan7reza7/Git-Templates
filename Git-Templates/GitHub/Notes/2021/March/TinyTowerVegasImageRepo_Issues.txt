### [January 2020] Data for January 15th 2020 is missing

Currently, I don't have access to data for January 15th 2020 for this project. It might be on an external hard drive. I can't check at the moment.

### [March 2020] Data for March 30th and 31st missing

Data for the 30th and 31st of March is not on my laptops solid state drive. This was around the time of the Ina Linux era, where I had difficulty managing files in the transition to Linux. The files are likely on an external hard drive. I don't have time to look for them at the moment.

Personal side note: It looks like data for May 29th 2020 is missing as well, I just have an empty directory.

Another note to prevent insanity tomorrow if I try to figure this out: it seems like normal TT data was swapped for TTV data for the 28th, the 29th has no errors, so data is missing for the 28th, 30th, and 31st. If I get my head stuck on this, I should remember.issue(1);

### [Final 2020] The final data of 2020 up to day 1XX is missing

The last of the Tiny Tower Vegas pictures from March 30th 2020 to an unknown date before August 2020 is currently not on my laptops solid state drive. I will need to dig through my external hard drives to find them at some point.

[Kept naming error] Original 3.13.2020 is actually March 12th 2020 #4

### [Kept naming error] Original 3.13.2020 is actually March 12th 2020

The original 3.13.2020 directory (the one without an `A` at the end) is actually for March 12th 2020. This is an error that was kept in the upload process. What happened is I accidentally named the March 12th 2020 data 1 day ahead by accident, then tried to correct it the next day without having to rename by doing the correct date, but with an A at the end.
