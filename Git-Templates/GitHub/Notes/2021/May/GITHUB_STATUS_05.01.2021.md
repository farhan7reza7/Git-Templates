### Status update: May 1st 2021

I had a very good day with development today. Today is the first day of May 2021, and I have a clean slate of progress today. Not all the data from May 1st comes in until the next day

I completed my journaling and gaming sessions early in the day again today. I tried a solution to my Saturday addiction problem. It really helped, but I don't think the source motivation was the 2 hour limit, I feel more like it is the battery limit. Luckily, I couldn't get the second game to load, so I ended up saving lots of time. My laptop continued to have battery problems today, and it crashed once. I might update my technical support article for mouse problems at some point, but I feel like I need more data first.

I have my first possible copycat on GitHub, although it might just be the person not knowing about the existing project. Someone made another Minecraft Python Edition project, with the same codename, but no source code. I have no power here, and I don't want to come across as evil, and anything I do to hurt the project would be bad. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery they say, although this might not be imitation, due to how many attempts there have been to make an open source version of Minecraft. Their version doesn't give off much info, but I will promote it [here anyways, just in case it makes progress](https://github.com/RedisKritov/mcpye)

I have a new GitHub organization project I have been working on today pretty heavily, I plan to create 7 organizations (1 row) per day, as I have a ton of ideas and topics that need a better platform. I have mostly been using GitHub organizations as projects or topics. I plan to exceed the 10 organization limit this month, but I won't be making more than 7 per day.

I got some progress made today. I decided to quit and go to bed a bit early, as I ran out of things I wanted to do, and I want to work on my schedule.

Today was a very good day for development.
