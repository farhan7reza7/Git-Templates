### Status update: May 2nd 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `23` _(as of May 2nd 2021 at 11:59:59 pm)_

I had a very difficult day today mentally. A series of touchpad calibration issues led to a ton of mental, emotional, and stress problems for me today.

I have not had a good day today, and due to constant crashes, and other issues, my work got constantly delayed and my schedule was screwed up. I am under constant stress of machine failure, and it is not getting easier over the years.

Today, I continued the GitHub organization project, but didn't do anything unique today besides different documentation. I have started to write a year in review for my first year of GitHub, which I have 23 more days to finish writing (goal) but can go longer if needed.

A family member has noted that the project that I mentioned yesterday was not a copycat, it was plagiarism. I still don't see it as plagiarism, as it isn't the official name, and as I have said, there have been many attempts to recreate Minecraft.

Today was not a very good day for development.
