### Status update: May 3rd 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `22` _(as of May 3rd 2021 at 11:59:59 pm)_

I had a good day with development today. I started a small change in my day (redacted) and it made it a lot easier for me today. Despite getting less than 8 hours of sleep last night, I did much better than I normally did, all the way to the end, with no errors.

Today, I finally ratified a decision on the release of a journaling module I considered sensitive. I decided it was fine to put out, and I committed a stripped down version that complies with GitHubs terms of service and file size limit. My sexuality center is now active. It took a long decision to do this.

Today, I also worked on some new projects that I came up with this morning and during my dental appointment, which was a new game based around slavery, and why it should be completely abolished (because unfortunately, slavery still exists in this world, and some of the biggest slave holders include Nestle, and certain other chocolate producers) I want to make this game with limited restrictions to show people how bad slavery is and to help push more people into doing something about freeing the slaves in the 21st century.

Another important project I started today was an article on laptops and desktop computers that come pre-installed with Linux, and info about them. I hope for it to be a researched catalogue (I am keeping the ue on this word, ignoring US English standards. I like it better this way) of Linux devices to make it easier for people to switch to Linux, and find a good Linux machine. I require experiences in this, and I have only had 2 Linux laptops, so I didn't have very much to contribute.

I had 2 medical appointments today, 1 mental, and 1 physical. My dentist appointment went great, and during a little chat with one of the dentists, I had an increased interest in Botony (Plant biology) and want to pick up another part-time hobby. One goal I have in mind is to increase the production of raspberries, so that they don't cost $6.00+ for a small package in stores, and so they are more easily accessible. They are my favorite fruit, but they are very difficult to harvest. That is why I am planning a machine that can do so, if one doesn't exist already. Otherwise, I don't see why they are so expensive.

Some other project ideas that came to mind today were for more image projects, and a proper journaling package for my opinion set.

<!-- Judging by the time of writing this draft (6:07:17 pm) I am unsure if I will be able to do GitHub organization work today. !-->

Other than all this, I did the usual GitHub work today, and also managed to do the organization work and my journaling work. I didn't have any time to work on my year in review article.

I am really tired, and I missed some sleep last night, so I will be going to bed soon/

Today was a | day for development
