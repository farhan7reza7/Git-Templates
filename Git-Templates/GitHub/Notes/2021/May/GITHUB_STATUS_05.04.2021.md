### Status update: May 4th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `21` _(as of May 4th 2021 at 11:59:59 pm)_

I had a good day with development today. I had my monthly gaming session and successfully managed to quell the addiction and save myself over 4 hours of time.

In Geek culture today, it was Star Wars day today (**May** the **4th** be with you) I have never been much of a Star Wars fan (to be honest, I have never seen any of the Star Wars movies in full, I have only seen about 8 minutes of footage across all films today) I did include 1 May 4th reference in a commit today.

I got some work done today, and I was in a generally good mood. I didn't make any progress towards my year in review article today, but I did work on Tetris 128 a bit (not very many commits were made, but a decent amount of time was spent compared to other projects)

I did further GitHub organization work today, adding 7 new projects. I generated more ideas, so this is going to drag on further unless/until a limitation is reached. 

Today was a | day for development
