### Status update: May 5th 2021

üéÇ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `20` _(as of May 5th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

I had an OK day with development today. I had so much available time to work today, but I didn't get as much done as I thought I would, but I still did a lot.

Today marks the introduction of a new feature that will be added to all my workflows, which is the dropdown feature. All markdown documents I make now that have a file history section will contain a dropdown, it is incredibly easy to make, I wish I would have learned this sooner.

I did work in various projects today, and listened to music on my phone while working. It is a really good system, and I really like it. It has brought me new experiences.

I stayed up pretty late, I hoped to go to bed earlier, but I didn't.

Today, I sent my previous laptop to a repair store in Oregon, @priceComputersLLC my family has a brief history with them, and they seem incredibly trustworthy. Going into the store gave me really good unexplainable vibes. I am hoping the issue can be fixed, but at the same time, it may be difficult to transition back to computer 1 again. Maybe a few system errors will sway my view.

Today, I updated my main profile README.md file twice, one update to add new content, and update to finalize a successful dropdown test.

I created 7 more organizations today. I am currently creating a 7x3 staircase of SNU projects in my GItHub organization listing.

I did some work on the Tetris128 project today, making it further with the concept, and laying out a roadmap. I plan on having as much Linux support as possible to boost Linux desktop share even further, and decreasing Windows and MacOS share slightly (this whole plan will only work if the game gains some traction)

I am deciding on how to how to make the game run with as little CPU as possible. The main problem being that playing with softbody graphics either requires a killer $10000 gaming computer, or a gigantic triage of efforts made to make the engine lighter. The demo I have contains less than 2 minutes of footage, and is reported to have taken ~36 hours to render. My plan is to be able to do this, but in real time (36 hours -> 60-1000 times per second) it is a very difficult goal, but I feel this, along with the other features (such as party mix, playing with other polyominoes, and the customization and open-ness of the game will completely revolutionize Tetris. I might even add in a battle royale mode if it is really needed.

Today, I very briefly worked on Mammal Town, laying the foundation to start adding characters to the game. Animal Crossing New Leaf was my inspiration for getting back into this. I only added 1 character today, so I didn't do much.

Today, I attempted some more torrents, but torrent 2 failed, as all the web seeds left and expired, leaving me stranded with a time estimation going towards the end of the Universe. So I just canceled it and did a direct download for the current and next 2 would-be torrents.

I worked briefly on the SNU 2D Translation service today, adding new language support. In the process of research, I find it weird how the system font recognizes Ancient Phoenician characters (~12000 BCE, about 14050+ years ago) yet it can't fully decode Javanese, or Mongolian, and some other languages I don't remember right now but use occasionally.

I worked on my text messaging instruction repository today, there was a lot of cleanup, fixes, and rewrites to do. It honestly looked like I was incredibly drunk while making it originally, yet I can remember that I actually thought it looked good back then. It is amazing how much I can change in just a few months.

Due to all these new topics/projects/Organizations, I have been doing a lot more forks. I have had a forking frenzy today.

Today, I played around a little bit on Gist.GitHub.com, as it is where I discovered using dropdowns in Markdown (which uses HTML5) I also learned something in HTML5, which is the `open` keyword will make the details of a dropdown display automatically. I don't currently see very much use in this for myself, but it might come in handy in the future.

```html
<details open>
<summary>This is open</summary>
<p lang="en">(üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è) YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO OPEN THE BOX DAVID</p>
<p lang="en">| | | - | | | _</p> <!-- Is this loss? !-->
</details>
```

I very briefly worked on my anti-slavery game today, just adding in some resource notes, and keeping the project active.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today.

Today was a decent day for development
