### Status update: May 6th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `19` _(as of May 6th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

I had an OK day with development today. 
Today marks the day since the introduction of a new feature that will be added to all my workflows, which is the dropdown feature. All markdown documents I make now that have a file history section will contain a dropdown, it is incredibly easy to make, I wish I would have learned this sooner. I didn't implement this anywhere today.

I did work in various projects today, and listened to music on my phone while working. It is a really good system, and I really like it. It has brought me new experiences. I have just been letting the playlist play instead of finding songs. 

I stayed up pretty late, I hoped to go to bed earlier, but I didn't.

I created 7 more organizations today. I am currently creating a 7x3 staircase of SNU projects in my GItHub organization listing. This goal failed today, and the 1st and 2nd stairs are now wobbly objects.

Today, I worked on Mammal Town, laying the foundation to start adding characters to the game. Animal Crossing New Leaf was my inspiration for getting back into this. I added 4 characters today, and heavily increased documentation.

Due to all these new topics/projects/Organizations, I have been doing a lot more forks. I have had another forking frenzy today.

Sorry for the terrifying GitHub dropdown yesterday featuring the details HTML tag, looking back, I really should not be writing documentation late at night this carelessly, and I should refrain from anything that tries so hard to be funny when it is being done at night. It is now on the growing pile of past embarrassments that I can't get out of my head (hopefully what I am writing now doesn't get added to that pile)

I did not do any work to my anti-slavery game today. I didn't know what to do with the project.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today.

Today was a decent day for development
