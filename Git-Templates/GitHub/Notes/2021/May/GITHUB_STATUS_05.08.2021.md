### Status update: May 8th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `17` _(as of May 8th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

I had a decent day with development today. 

I tried to do tasks other than image and documentation work on the usual projects today, I worked on some other lesser-worked on projects as well. This GitHub Organization task isn't eating too far into my time, I only work on it for 25-80 minutes per day. I went ahead and calculated the rest of the possible projects, and it is expected now to finish up on June 2nd 2021. More may be added, and it could get extended up to June 20th 2021, but I went through all my projects today to make sure.

Regarding screenshots, I am really considering what has to be done to change the project language on my GitHub image project to make it Ruby 50.1% instead of Go 100% as I don't want an extremely common project to be associated with this. Also, I plan on dropping the xx255 screenshot from the cycle, as it is too tedious to get both 255 and 256, and a bit unnecessary.

I created 7 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal, but I am now expecting it to drag on to June 2nd 2021 or further (see above)

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a decent day for development
