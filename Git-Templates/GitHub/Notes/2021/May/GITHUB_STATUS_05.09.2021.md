### Status update: May 9th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `16` _(as of May 9th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a decent day with development today. 

Today is Mothers Day (2021) I didn't make any Mothers Day type projects, but I have a new plan I am working on regarding user interface and hardware friendliness, as the elderly and people with disabilities seem to be widely ignored when it comes to this. A new problem I have found today is that older people have difficulty with smaller keyboards, and since most laptops are getting ridiculously small and less powerful (now most laptops require a dongle unfortunately, which I really hate) it is getting hard for my mom to get a new computer. We considered the Microsoft Surface Pro 7, but it appears the keyboard is just too small and it likely requires a dongle, which is a double no for her (for me, it would be a triple no, because Windows 10 is on it and it likely doesn't have good Linux support)

Another problem I have already been attacking is the presence of flat design, which makes user interfaces not only a lot uglier, but also over 16% more difficult to learn and use, not only for the elderly, but for everyone. Skeuomorphism really needs to come back, and I await the day it does. I have been suffering with garbage flat systems for nearly a decade now (last = iOS 6, Windows 7, Android 2.3 Gingerbread)

I did some actual programming today... well technically just shell scripting. I worked on my integer overflow by date project (YKDefender) and contributed 2 new original scripts (4 total) I had to re-learn MS-DOS Batch files slightly. I did some other work today as well, including higher level documentation.

I updated my GitHub profile README.md file today. Earlier this month, I discovered dropdowns in markdown, and learned a new way of doing it: `<details open>` I didn't think I would ever use it, but I found some useful uses for it today.

I created 7 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal, but I am now expecting it to drag on to June 4th 2021 or further. I keep getting more new ideas. I am hoping to eventually finish this task.

Today, I surpassed 5000 stars on GitHub. In the next 2 days (by May 11th 2021) I will know if GitHub supports having 5000+ stars (as I know YouTube and Twitter don't, at least when I used to use them)

I renovated some old projects today and stayed up a bit late while working.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a decent day for development
