### Status update: May 10th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `15` _(as of May 10th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Y1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a decent day with development today. 

Today for my mass-organization creation and registration process, I bumped up the speed from 7 organizations per day to 10. I won't go above this, as I want all of them to be able to show in each day of the calendar in full (if I were to create 11, it would cut off 1) this change has let me take the time down by 7 days, with a finish line back in May 2021 again. They aren't being made in rows, but this is necessary to complete this project faster and move on. It took a lot of time to do so today, and I made nearly 400 forks today in the process. It should be easier tomorrow.

In my image work today, I found that I didn't write day-by-day template status posts last Monday for my gaming sessions. I have corrected this today, although I don't know how I forgot in the first place.

Today I have found that one of my projects ([Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM)) has reached 10 stars, my first project to reach double digits. I wish I could improve it more, but I don't have enough ideas at the moment. It is a big milestone for me. I have been watching this project for a few months, and I have seen it grow popular. Thanks to everyone who supported it. I will do what I can to continue to improve it. (I did make a small set of improvements today not mentioning this milestone, but I don't feel like it was enough)

I did some actual programming today... well technically just shell scripting. I worked on my integer overflow by date project (YKDefender) and contributed 2 new original scripts (4 total) I had to re-learn MS-DOS Batch files slightly. I did some other work today as well, including higher level documentation.

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I keep getting more new ideas. I am hoping to eventually finish this task. See above for more info

Today, I surpassed 5000 stars on GitHub. I can now confirm (at least for myself) that GitHub doesn't limit its users to 5000 stars/follows/likes like YouTube and Twitter do. I exceeded 5.3 thousand stars today.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a decent day for development
