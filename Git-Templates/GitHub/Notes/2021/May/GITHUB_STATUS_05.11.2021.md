### Status update: May 11th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `14` _(as of May 11th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a weak day with development today. 

I continued my goal of creating GitHub organizations for platform and registration, creating 10 more today. I woke up early today and was able to get work on this project done, although I decided to go to bed earlier tonight, as I want to fix my schedule.

I did lots of documentation work and optimizations to existing documentation today. Some notable documentation work was an update to my article against Google WideVine (DRM) my GitHub profile `README.md` file, and finalized the ProjectWiki in 3 projects. I am going to start getting paid soon, so I have to do some planning on how to sort my earnings (I have decided to invest half into spendable money that goes towards the essentials, like servers, service repair, personal expenses, and fuel) and half goes to stock up to start my career in computer business (equipment manufacturing, worker payment (a good wage, at least quadruple the current minimum wage for all workers, everyone will get paid the same) non-malicious advertising, among other things.

I have been doing a lot of archiving, sorting, and planning today, and also getting distracted with other projects. I didn't do very well today development wise.

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I keep getting more new ideas. I am hoping to eventually finish this task. See above for more info

Today, I surpassed 5500 stars on GitHub. I can now confirm (at least for myself) that GitHub doesn't limit its users to 5000 stars/follows/likes like YouTube and Twitter do. I exceeded 5.6 thousand stars today.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a decent day for development
