### Status update: May 12th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `13` _(as of May 12th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a very good day with development today, despite what I tell myself (lately, I haven't been able to determine what is considered "enough" work for a day)

I continued my goal of creating GitHub organizations for platform and registration, creating 10 more today. I woke up early today and was able to get work on this project done, although I decided to go to bed early again tonight, as I want to continue to fix my schedule

Today was a pretty big day today. I had a list of ideas to get through, and I am planning on resuming work on some older plans pretty soon. I am slowly working towards 1000 repositories, with a scope of everything I need.

Today, I had an influx of followers (4 followers in 1 day) as of 8:17 pm, I am up to 150 followers. I am also finally getting some more interaction on my projects. Today, I had my first external contribution my anti-Google WideVine article, somebody had the time to help replace a graphic with a transparent version. This is the 3rd time somebody other than me has contributed to one of my projects in my GitHub history, and I am grateful for every contribution. Thanks to the user [@GaurPeeyush](https://github.com/GaurPeeyush) for helping out today. (also, India is really affected by COVID-19 at the moment, and this user reports themselves to be from there. I hope you make it through this with minimal suffering, these are tough times. Good luck with your web development. I hope you are OK)

I have had my computer in for repair for a while now, I finally got to pick it up today. I am not yet fully ready to give a full review on Price Computers LLC, as I haven't made sure the data is safe. Once that is done, I am willing to give a 100/100 review. It is a really nice little computer store, and it gives off good vibes. They have also been in business as a small company for 39 years, so they had to have done something right to do so. So far, I have been able to tell that the operating system is reinstalled, which is great. The service there is really nice and professional, and they really seem to know what they are doing.

I didn't do very much file sorting today, I am still on my backup laptop and I am preparing to move back to the main one, once I recover my data onto it. It is still going to take up to a week or longer to transition back.

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I keep getting more new ideas, but the flow has slowed down, so that I am not making negative-positive progress again. I am hoping to eventually finish this task. See above for more info

Today, I surpassed 5700 stars on GitHub. I can now confirm (at least for myself) that GitHub doesn't limit its users to 5000 stars/follows/likes like YouTube and Twitter do. I exceeded 5.6 thousand stars today.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a decent day for development
