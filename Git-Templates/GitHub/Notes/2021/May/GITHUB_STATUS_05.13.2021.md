### Status update: May 13th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `12` _(as of May 13th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a very bad day today, but an OK day with development. Many things went wrong today, and it was generally very difficult for me. I gained at leaat 6 new problems today, of which 3 are major/critical.

I continued my goal of creating GitHub organizations for platform and registration, creating 10 more today. I woke up early today and was able to get work on this project done, although I decided to go to bed early again tonight, but it is starting to wane back towards going to bed later and later. I got less than 8 hours of sleep last night, and I have been getting woken up before 7:00 am, so this isn't good. I generated ideas for 7+ days worth of new organizations, and the estimate has been moved up to June 4th/June 5th 2021.

I tested out the laptop backup today. I can't comment too much on it yet, I need to message Price Computers tomorrow when available. I really wish I didn't take the advice of "its OK to not backup your data tonight, they wouldn't have their job if they didn't know what they were doing" as it has led to a series of unfortunate events that just keep getting worse. The new issue I am trying to fix now is getting all my files relocated. There were over 2 million files, and my estimate for getting everything fixed again is 609 hours of renaming, 3 hours per day (~40 million seconds) however, this calculation was probably not too good. The concern I am currently having is that the files aren't in their original folders, and don't have their original names, but a software tool was used to sort them by their file type. I might have to revert to an older backup for most data (luckily, I don't have to rename too many files, just ~100000+ files in the past 1.1-3.6 months, so my past calculation was pointless. I am just writing this description as I go, figuring it out in my head as I write more) I am hoping the metadata retained some filename info. At least the files aren't lost, that is the best part. I am pretty sure that this was done due to difficulty accessing the data. They even took the time to create 2 backup formats of system and app data along with the bootloader (GRUB) in FAT32 and HFS+ formats (no program data was lost either, that's a bonus) I am still not 100% on this, it caused a pretty big issue tonight, and I will need to look into it further.

I was a bit scared at first, as the drive wasn't recognized on a Windows 10 laptop, which I tried first, as I didn't want to use a dongle. Apparently, it was formatted directly for Linux only, not Windows. The laptop has a weird screen flickering problem now at bootup, but is fine afterwards. I also got a new hard drive out of this, which I dubbed AD-A (codename Ada Price) which will be my 2 terabyte drive for backups only (see more on my [personal server info repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Personal-Server-Info))

<!-- I didn't do very much file sorting today, I am still on my backup laptop and I am preparing to move back to the main one, once I recover my data onto it. It is still going to take up to a week or longer to transition back. !-->

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I keep getting new ideas, and the flow went up by 7 days today, so I am making negative-positive progress again. I am hoping to eventually finish this task. See above for more info.

Today, I surpassed 5800 stars on GitHub. I am also rapidly gaining followers due to "investing" in some trends, such as GitHub education and Apache FreeMarker. I am just one of the few people who both watches and stars repositories.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was an OK day for development
