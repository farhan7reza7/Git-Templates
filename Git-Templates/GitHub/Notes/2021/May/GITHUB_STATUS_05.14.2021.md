### Status update: May 14th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `11` _(as of May 14th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a much better day today, but just an OK day with development.

I am able to finalize my review on the drive. I was on call with the store today, and I found where the files were located. I was upset over nothing last night, everything has worked out fine. My final review on Price Computers LLC is 100/100 for computer repair.

<!-- I didn't do very much file sorting today, I am still on my backup laptop and I am preparing to move back to the main one, once I recover my data onto it. It is still going to take up to a week or longer to transition back. !-->

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I keep getting new ideas, and the flow went up by 7 days today, so I am making negative-positive progress again. I am hoping to eventually finish this task. See above for more info.

Today, I surpassed 6000 stars on GitHub. I didn't do much today, just more of what I did yesterday. I had more downtime today, and did mass forking. I have resolved all but 1 issue that came up yesterday, which is a high level of tension (TMJ) I am dealing with.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was an OK day for development
