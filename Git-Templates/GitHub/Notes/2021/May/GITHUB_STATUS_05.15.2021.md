### Status update: May 15th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `10` _(as of May 15th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a better day today, and a good day with development.

I am able to finalize my review on the drive. I was on call with the store today, and I found where the files were located. I was upset over nothing last night, everything has worked out fine. My final review on Price Computers LLC is 100/100 for computer repair.

<!-- I didn't do very much file sorting today, I am still on my backup laptop and I am preparing to move back to the main one, once I recover my data onto it. It is still going to take up to a week or longer to transition back. !-->

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I keep getting new ideas, and the flow didn't go up today, so I made positive-positive progress and not positive-negative progress (positive-negative means I made progress, but also didn't get much closer to the goal, as part of my progress was in moving the goal post forward)

Last night when browsing GitHub topics, I discovered a new purpose for my image projects. They won't just be for stock images and progress monitoring anymore, I have decided to expand their purpose by adding in machine learning support, as I have a pretty good collection compared to the popular one I found (unsplash) although my collection mostly leans on gaming, which would be important for machine learning. I am still trying to figure out how to configure this and display this across all the projects.

I have recently gained a much higher interest in Firefox profiles again recently, and I have been getting creative with it again. I spent some time doing so today.

Today, I worked on various project, and started work on the 6 new projects that I have had planned out in my notes for a bit.

Today, I surpassed 6100 stars on GitHub. My computer completely crashed earlier (completely unresponsive, had to use the 10 second hard power cycle trick) at `17:30:48` and I lost all of my network data up to this point (the system monitors collection of uploads/downloads rate, not a big loss. Download was near 500 MiB last time I checked, and upload was near 1.0 GiB. This was 3 minutes before the crash) I am wondering if accidentally summoning VLC Media Player last night caused this. I also noticed poor performance up to this point, as my system was lagging heavily. I am also suspecting high cache and bad memory and processor reports may have contributed to the crash (this laptop has been under-reporting how much CPU and RAM is being used, and if it reached max capacity, it would crash. For example, my laptop constantly reports 10-20+ percent CPU usage across all 8 cores combined, but when I look at the processes and daemons, all of them together don't even equal 5%) there were 2 additional crashes today, 1 wasn't fatal, 1 wasn't as fatal but still required a reboot (the additional 2 were cursor/desktop crashes) I plan to try and get my main laptop back upand running tomorrow.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a good day for development
