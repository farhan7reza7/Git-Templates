### Status update: May 16th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `09` _(as of May 16th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a better day today, and a decent day with development.

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I keep getting new ideas, and the flow didn't go up today, so I made positive-positive progress and not positive-negative progress (positive-negative means I made progress, but also didn't get much closer to the goal, as part of my progress was in moving the goal post forward) it still took over 3 hours today, and it set me back a bit, but I enjoyed doing it. I also did Firefox profile customization in the process (as I create a new profile for each organization) I have recently gained a much higher interest in Firefox profiles again recently, and I have been getting creative with it again. I spent some time doing so today.

Today, I worked on various project, and continued work on the 6 new projects that I have had planned out in my notes for a bit. I also finally made proper documentation for my `IGNORE.md` file system.

I really wanted to continue work tonight, but I was too unfocused. I hope to try to go to bed earlier so I have more time tomorrow. I have 2 medical appointments tomorrow morning.

Today, I surpassed 6300 stars on GitHub. I didn't do much on GitHub today other than the usual work.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a decent day for development
