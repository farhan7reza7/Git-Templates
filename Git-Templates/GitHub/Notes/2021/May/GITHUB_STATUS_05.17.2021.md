### Status update: May 17th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `08` _(as of May 17th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a difficult day today, and a decent day with development.

I got woken up very early this morning and was unable to get back to sleep, meaning I got less than 5 hours of sleep last night. I tried everything I could last night to make this not happen, but it all failed.

I was in a lot of pain for most of the morning, but I was able to have a good time and be productive. I did my first external hard drive backup in over a month, and got my leisure gaming sessions completed early. I only had 1 medical appointment today, the next one is actually tomorrow. There was a lot of internal confusion towards this.

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I keep getting new ideas, and the flow didn't go up today, so I made positive-positive progress and not positive-negative progress (positive-negative means I made progress, but also didn't get much closer to the goal, as part of my progress was in moving the goal post forward) it took significantly less time today compared to yesterday, but there wasn't as much to do. 

Today, I worked on various projects, and continued work on 5 out of the 6 new projects that I have had planned out in my notes for a bit. I was going to do this last night, but I became too tired. I have to go to bed earlier tonight, so I am wrapping up early.

I really wanted to continue work tonight, but I needed to go to bed earlier to get better sleep tonight.

Today, I surpassed 6400 stars on GitHub. I didn't do much on GitHub today other than the usual work. I did resume work on 5 of the 6 projects I have been holding off. I am getting close to reaching 2 goals by May 25th 2021 (163 followers, 65536 commits) I feel like I can make the 2nd one, but the first one I am still unsure on.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a decent day for development
