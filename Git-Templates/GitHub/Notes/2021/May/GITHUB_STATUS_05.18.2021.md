### Status update: May 18th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `07` _(as of May 18th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a very good day with development today, and a pretty good day today.

I had a longer than expected gaming session this morning that didn't drag on for too long, and also got cut in half due to a doctors appointment over the phone that lasted less than 9 minutes but was an effective check-up.

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I keep getting new ideas, and the flow didn't go up today, so I made positive-positive progress and not positive-negative progress (positive-negative means I made progress, but also didn't get much closer to the goal, as part of my progress was in moving the goal post forward) it took less time today compared to yesterday again, but there wasn't as much to do. 

Yesterday, I doomed myself with even more organization work, but the work is necessary. I am now documenting all the individual organizations. This would have worked better if I had planned for it sooner.

Today, I worked on various projects, and continued work on 5 out of the 6 new projects that I have had planned out in my notes for a bit. I was going to do this last night, but I became too tired. I have to go to bed earlier tonight, so I am wrapping up early. I made lots of progress on the Google Drive module and Website Archives module, but felt that these projects were not as important as others.

Today, I did research on the Python programming language, and networking, so I can better myself. I learned a lot today via Wikiversity. I got to learn 6 new terms, and start remastering the first 11 chapters of my 2 years of Python class in High School.
Stayed up late again, even later

I got enough done today, and didn't need to stay up extra late. I still stayed up pretty late though. I also reached 2^16 (65,536 commits) today, which was a major accomplishment. I began finalizing work near 11:00 pm, and hope to make more progress tomorrow.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a very good day for development
