# GitHub year in review

## Seanpm2001 first year of GitHub

### Intro

<!-- I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020 to get my many projects out there. I am skilled in computer programming, and I have many interests. !-->

I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020. I was new to Git, and I was still trying to switch to Linux at this point. On this day, I decided to create a GitHub account to get my projects out there, as I felt there was no other way.

### Commits (2020)

### Pros

1. I got to learn Git, although I am far from becoming intermediate in working with Git.

2. I was introduced to markdown, and I made significant progress in learning markdown. Markdown nearly replaced plain text for me.

3. I got to learn many new programming languages

4. I got to learn better project management

5. I have 1 safe place for all my programming

6. I am getting help with my projects with the software development community

7. I have a new platform for myself

### Cons

1. Joining GitHub crippled my classical development style of SNU (due to the 25 megabyte file limit, and the 1000 files per directory limit) and made keeping snapshots and working on it not as easy. I still made progress in SNU development, but not as great as the classical era (2018-2020)
