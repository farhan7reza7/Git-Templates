Meeting a guest outside, Monika "Jolly" (unknown if this is her last name, she declared this later on)

Laptop plugged in 55% battery 8:10 pm, needed to converse some more battery for later
Continued work, finalizations
ProtonMail cleared out
Writing a note for Monika to keep in touch, as I thought she would be leaving tomorrow morning
My day was finally interesting for once, I stayed outside extra, because I was actually able to have fun socializing and doing something outside of the norm
Monika has some speech patterns (she is extremely expressive and creative with her words) which made me slightly uncomfortable at first, but it is unique and I am getting used to them. I am increasing our friendship, as she has been living alone for years, and has been very lonely, and we share several interests and beliefs. This is a friend I don't want to lose
I have now noted that several people like the smirk I make when amused. I am starting to realize the potential of this and not consider myself ugly anymore
