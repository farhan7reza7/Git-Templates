Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

<!-- August 17th 2021
Mention: I am using Social Media and the Internet the way it should be, uncensored talks and about the creator, and not about a company (like the Internet used to be like partially before 2007)

I have been meaning to mention this for a while, but my cellular device has been having an on and off problem for over a month now, where a certain screenshot I take every once in a while (and the 0-6 screenshots after it) will not hide the screenshot preview until it fully expires (this process canâ€™t be rushed) and afterwards, the problem by this screenshot lag will either cause the phone to become unresponsive until you turn off the screen or let you continue but have all buttons break and zooming to become completely broken and forced. The fix to this is to minimize and maximize the current app, then turn the phone off and turn it back on and quickly minimize and maximize the app. It it tedious as hell. It started in July 2021.

I got the normal work done today, but didn't get to unique programming projects as planned. I hope things return to normal later next week.

Wiki guidelines

Problem: GitHub has no protections for Wikis for projects with collaborators, as I can restrict editing for non-collaborators, but I can't control who else can work on the Wiki. I can't trust collaborators on projects with Wikis, no matter how good of a person they are, as their accounts can still be hijacked, and someone can come in and hide bad things into the Wikis and do other types of vandalism. I don't want a GitHub marketplace bot to help me with this, as if the bot goes down, then the vandalism starts.

So for collaborators, there are guidelines for writing Wikis here.

I got enough done today, and I still have plans for tomorrow, including working on the core SNU repository, and my tribute to the late [Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) (as tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of his passing[1](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna44910730) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/technology/dennis-ritchie-programming-trailblazer-dies-at-70.html) [3](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15287391) [4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/dennis-ritchie-founder-of-unix-and-c-dies-at-70/2011/10/13/gIQAXsVXiL_story.html) [5](https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dennis-ritchie-20111014-story.html) [6](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/13/dennis-ritchie) [7](https://www.cnet.com/news/dennis-ritchie-father-of-c-programming-language-dies/) [8](https://www.wired.com/2011/10/dennis-ritchie/)) he never really was a household name, but he is still someone worth talking about. It is still frustrating that Steve Jobs died in the same month as him, as so many people went to mourn Steve Jobs while hardly anyone went to mourn Dennis Ritchie, you know, creator of the C programming language that is on practically every computer right now, and the UNIX operating system, which its descendents are used on over 90% of the worlds servers, and on 500 out of 500 of the top 500 supercomputers (yes, all 500 of the top supercomputers run Linux) [1](https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/share/SupercomputersLinux.pdf) [2](https://www.stackscale.com/blog/most-powerful-supercomputers-linux/) [3](https://itsfoss.com/linux-runs-top-supercomputers/) [4](https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-linux-all-the-time-supercomputers-top-500/) I also plan to keep website development going, as I am making some real progress (7 websites in 2 days) and I am hoping to eventually finish this website project/keep it up to date. I also don't want to rush it, so give me 5 years tops for the current 655.

My battery problem, not hearing anyone else have battery problems:
I am really disappointed in this laptops poor battery life. I saw an image of a laptop that was over an inch thick today, and it made me miss having that. They used to only be able to fit 1-2 hours of battery life into those things, and they can fit 2-4 hours of battery life in ones like the one I have, so why canâ€™t we just go back to inch thick laptops, but with 24-48+ hour batteries? It is just a really difficult problem with a very easy solution that negatively impacts my life, and most likely other peoples lives as well. However, I have never heard a single other person complain about laptop battery life yet, which I find to be really surprising. I took this passage from my journaling and slightly modified it, as I need to make my voice heard. Having laptops that are just a couple centimeters thick just isn't sustainable if they have to be over 3x more expensive, and have 60x less functionality

Not only does it touch on multiple of my major interests (outer space/maps/travel, and web development) but it has a built-in pun.

Reading my first piece of criticism from another GitHub user, from 2021 July 15th (nearly 3 and a half months ago) (I don't check my notifications that much) regarding robotics. I am not going to respond directly, but I am going to write a response here regarding the subject.

Direct quote: (From [@Davisogunsina](https://github.com/Davisogunsina)

```
what do you know about robotics odometry ? do you have any idea ...
```

I have only built 2 robots in total, and didn't finish either of them. One of them was a school project that got cut, as I wasn't given any instructions, and was only given 2 hours total (it was just an extra task, as I finished my Python course early) and the other one was too difficult to do, as I didn't have the experience at the time, and the instructions came on a small CD-ROM in Chinese, and required the installation of programs that I didn't trust. There were already 2 essential missing pieces of hardware at this point, so I unfortunately gave up on this Arduino project as well.

From time to time, I like to tinker with different ideas and subjects. The criticism I was given was "do you even know anything about robotics?" Yes, I know the very basics. A lot of my projects are designed to be worked on as a group/as a team. I am still very young, and I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, so I will gain an interest again at some point. I feel like I am the type of person who will always be willing to learn new things, even at the age of 90.

I might not be the one to do the hardware parts of the robotics, but I can definitely do the software parts. Some basic robots can even be programmed using Scratch, BYOB, or other block-based languages, but if I have the option, I will likely go for a functional programming language instead, such as C, C++, Java, or Python.

I had the feeling that I was going to see a negative comment after reading a positive one, and I was right. Although, this is just the re-start (second start) of my getting used to criticism and hate speech online, as there is no avoiding it, and it is sometimes needed (criticism is sometimes needed, hate speech isn't ever needed)

Confirming that it is a software problem and not a hardware problem, fan works fine, supportAssistant works horribly: switch situation: yesterday.restart(fan=on, error=false) today.restart(fan=off,error=true)

Due to 5.2 GiB of cache being in use, I had to restart. My CPU fan wasnâ€™t running at the time, and I was able to confirm yesterdays theory on the CPU fan further. Yesterday when restarting, the fan was already running, so the SupportAssistant error screen didnâ€™t come up. Today when restarting, the fan was not running, and the SupportAssistant screen did come up. So it can both come up and not come up at restart, and it further proves that the SupportAssistant is not able to properly turn on the processor fan for testing.
