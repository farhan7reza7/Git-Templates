# Forking languages

# 2021 November 10th

I am forking language repositories to source my language organizations a bit better, and to diversify my stars and forks a bit. This document goes over some of the significant changes so far.

The forked languages section is for language repositories I was successfully able to fork. The CF;DE (Can't Fork, Doesn't Exist) section is for languages that don't have a language repository or language repository equivalent on GitHub (or I just couldn't find it yet) the Needs fork section is for projects that need to be forked, but an organization doesn't exist yet. Finally, the to-test section is for languages I need to test with.
