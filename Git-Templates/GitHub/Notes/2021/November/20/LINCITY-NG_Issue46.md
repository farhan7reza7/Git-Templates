[Feature request] Volunteer language support (Greek, Esperanto, or Korean) #46

***

### [Feature request] Volunteer language support (Greek, Esperanto, or Korean)

I am interested in this game, and I would like to help contribute to it. I don't think I would be able to help with the programming, since I am not experienced with the languages used, but I could try to add some locale support.

I can do some translations for any language, I was thinking either Greek, Esperanto, Korean, or all 3 (they are ones with millions of native speakers) it wouldn't increase the size too much, I estimate it would only increase by 102-180 kilobytes. Any translation errors can be fixed by native speakers, as I will be using a translating service. I would like to take a try at adding support for these languages (Greek: EL | Esperanto: EO | Korean: KO)

I can do other languages if you want as well.

If @uafr or any of the other trusted contributors are OK with this, I will try to do so later today, tomorrow, or any time within the next 7 days. This will be my first external GitHub contribution if I have permission.

Thank you for your time - SeanPM

I just noticed: this project hasn't been active for 14 months. @uafr do you have any interest in resuming this project?

Greek translation is already included. No idea how complete it is at the moment. Not
really sure if machine translation is the way to go. At least for languages I understand
the results were not too convincing.
