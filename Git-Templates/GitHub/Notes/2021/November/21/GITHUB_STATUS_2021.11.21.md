I have noted throughout my life that a lot of people don't know how to say my name. Some people pronounce it "seen" or other ways. This section will go over the pronounciation of `sean`

`Sean` is the Irish spelling of the name. I have been told throughout my life that it is the original spelling, but I have yet to fact check that. It is pronounced the same as `Shaun` or `Shawn` which is pronounced like `shh` (shh as in what the librarian says when you are being an annoyance to the public, seriously though, librarians are awesome) - `awn` (as in yawn, but without the y) I had to give an in-depth example, as it is hard to get the point across through text

Highly productive day, little sleep, woken up early

Project development method

I rely on the community to take interest in projects to tell me what needs to be worked on. There are a lot of projects, and unless I have stated that they are dead, they are NOT dead. Sometimes I even bring them back from the dead. They are actually just waiting for someone to take interest in them. I cannot manage all 1300+ projects by myself, and I need additional contributors to help. It has always been the plan to get an additional developer or someone to take interest. Meanwhile, I will continue to work on what I feel like doing.

I had a highly productive day today. I got little sleep, as I was woken up early. I worked on several projects, and got partially caught up. I also started several new projects today. Today I quietly worked on several small fixes and tweaks to some projects and personal settings.

I skipped audio database conversion work today, along with partial mass forking work. I worked on creating 10 out of 19 new organizations as well.

<!-- 2021 November 20th
Also today, I decided to decide to discontinue or repurpose the SNU NFT project. I have found that the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens goes against my morals (because it is "intellectual" "property") note that the term 'intellectual property' is a buzzword and should not be used. IP should NOT refer to 'intellectual property'

### The situation with laptop batteries and functionality

I am really disappointed in my current laptops poor battery life. I saw an image of a laptop that was over an inch thick today, and it made me miss having that. They used to only be able to fit 1-2 hours of battery life into those things, and they can fit 2-4 hours of battery life in ones like the one I have, so why can‚Äôt we just go back to inch thick laptops, but with 24-48+ hour batteries? It is just a really difficult problem with a very easy solution that negatively impacts my life, and most likely other peoples lives as well. However, I have never heard a single other person complain about laptop battery life yet, which I find to be really surprising. I took this passage from my journaling and slightly modified it, as I need to make my voice heard. Having laptops that are just a couple centimeters thick just isn't sustainable if they have to be over 3x more expensive, and have 60x less functionality

**This section was last updated on 2021, Tuesday, October 5th at 12:18 am**

### Why laptops should become thick again

Laptops should become thick again. This trend of making everything smaller just makes it less functional and more expensive. I lost count of how many times I have made the argument for bigger computers. If I had a 5 pound laptop compared to a ~0.5 pound laptop, I could have such higher functionality, such as not having to use a defective dongle, having a 24+ hour battery life rather than a 2-4 hour battery life, being able to store over 2000 terabytes of data (think this isn't feasible, look no further than the 2 terabyte microSD card that is smaller than a popcorn kernel, now imagine hundreds or thousands of those, it would take up as much space as an external 2 terabyte drive from 2020, but could hold much more) being able to have over a terabyte of RAM, and more. I don't want a Macbook lighter than air, I want a functional computer.

Apple has finally admitted that they were wrong when it comes to making laptops smaller. They are now trying to fix a huge problem they created. [Source: the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future)

### Learning JavaScript

#### Hello world in JavaScript

A simple Hello world program to print out to the web console

```javascript
console.log("Hello WorldWideWeb!");
```

_(i) This example has been tested yet, and works._

#### Variables in JavaScript

Variables in JavaScript

```javascript
var x = 2
var y = 16
console.log(2**16);
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Break in JavaScript

The break keyword in JavaScript

```javascript
console.log("Break time!");
break;
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work. I still don't know exactly what the `break` keyword does_

#### Functions in JavaScript

Functions in JavaScript

```javascript
function aFunctionalFunction {
	console.log("A functional function has finished functioning.");
	break;
}
return aFunctionalFunction();
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Return in JavaScript

Returning in JavaScript

```javascript
function aFunctionalFunction {
	console.log("A functional function has finished functioning.");
	break;
}
return aFunctionalFunction();
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Alert in JavaScript

The alert command creates an alerting dialogue box. 

```javascript
alert("Alert! The alert dialog box is now present");
break;
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

Spamming this function can result in a checkmarkable option to stop displaying popups, as they can get annoying.

```javascript
var x = bool(true)
function alertAlot {
	while (x == true) {
		alert("I am an alert");
		break;
	}
}
return alerAlot();
break;
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Comments in JavaScript

Comments in JavaScript are identical to comments in C or C++.

```javascript
// This is a single line comment
/* This
is a multiline
comment */
/* Multi-line comments
* can also
* be written
* like this */
```

#### For loop in JavaScript

Here is an example of a `for` loop in JavaScript:

```javascript
let x = 0;
for x in range(1,10) {
	console.log(x);
}
```

I am not sure if JavaScript supports the `range` keyword in the same way that Python does.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### While loop in JavaScript

Here is an example of a `while` loop in JavaScript

```javascript
let x = -16;
while x > 0 {
	console.log(x)
	x == x + 1;
}
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### If statement in JavaScript

Section coming soon

#### Drawing in JavaScript

Section coming soon

#### Classes in JavaScript

Classes are a feature in JavaScript. The way I know them, they are extremely similar to other languages. At the moment, I don't see much purpose in classes, so I am likely missing something and need to find out what.

```javascript
class superClass {
	console.log("Superclass says Hello");
}
```

#### OnClick in JavaScript

This example is going to include HTML alongside JavaScript. The 2 languages work strongly together (along with CSS), so this shouldn't be surprising.

Here is the JavaScript portion:

```javascript
function javaScript {
	console.log("Object.OnClick activated, alerting message is going to be sent. If you didn't receive the message, you may have disabled dialog boxes for this page.");
	alert("Hello HTML, from JavaScript");
}
object.onclick = function(){javaScript}; 
```

Here is the HTML5 portion:

```html
<HTML>
<button>Click me!<element onclick="myScript">
</HTML>
```

#### Blink tag in JavaScript

The blink tag requires HTML, CSS, AND JavaScript to work. The tag was deprecated, as it was too annoying, and disruptive, but most web browsers still support it.

```javascript
// JQuery example
setInterval(function(){
	$('blink').each(function() {
		$(this).toggle();
});
}, 250);
// Vanilla JavaScript example
(function() {
	var blinks = document.getElementsByTagName('blink');
	var visibility = 'hidden';
	window.setInterval(function() {
	for (var i = blinks.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		blinks[i].style.visibility = visibility;
}
	visibility = (visibility === 'visible') ? 'hidden' : 'visible';
	}, 250);
})();
```

### Learning Java

Despite taking an AP class on Java, I did not do very well, as I didn't like the language very much at the time, and still don't like it too much. Nonetheless, I still did learn some Java. This document will go over my knowledge of the Java programming language.

#### Hello World in Java

A standard Hello World program in Java. I memorized the class and System.out.println lines, but I still haven't memorized the public static void portion.

```java
public class java {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Originally, I got stumped in class in the beginning, as I couldn't figure out if the `l` in `println` was a capital `i`, or a `1`.

#### Operators in Java

**Section coming soon**

#### Classes in Java

I have to give credit to one of my friends for a joke in this example, there was a funny joke he made when we were going over superclasses, and he came up with the term `super duper mega class` in his answer. I did not come up with this one.

```java
public class superDuperMegaClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome back to Java class");
    }
}
```

#### Functions in Java

```java
public static void aFunctionalFunction() {
	System.out.println("This function has functioned its functioning function.");
}
return aFunctionalFunction();
```

#### Importing in Java

Importing just the Java utilities (scanner) this will also be used in the next example.

```java
import java.util.scanner();
```

Importing ALL Java libraries (not always recommended)

```java
import *
```

#### Input scanners in Java

I never nailed this one down, but it was deemed very important to me.

```java
import java.util.scanner();
// Blank for now



















```

**I can't do the rest of this right now.**

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Garbage collection in Java

* can also
* be written
* like this */
```

#### Other knowledge of Java

1. Java can be used as a gateway language to C#, C, C++, Google Go, and other languages

2. Java is not to be confused with JavaScript, although JavaScript was influenced by Java. The same goes for JScript, JavaScript++, and other JavaScript-like languages

3. Java was originally developed by Sun Microsystems in an attempt to create a better TV remote.

4. Java is now owned by Oracle

5. Java was originally named Oak, after an Oak tree outside the developers office.

6. Eclipse is an IDE I learned Java in.

7. Java programs are very verbose (long) compared to languages like Python

8. Java is a curly bracket and semicolon language

9. Javas syntax is very similar to the syntax of C# and sometimes C# is jokingly called `Microsoft Java`

10. Java's main file format is `.java` but it uses many other file formats, such as `.gradle` `.jar` `.

11. Jar files are Java Archive files

12. The popular game `Minecraft` was originally written in Java. The Microsoft version is written in C++

13. Java can be used as an applet for web browsers

14. Javas mascot is named `Duke`

15. Java has its own virtual machine, known as the JVM (or Java Virtual Machine) for executing Java source code

16. No other knowledge of the Java programming language at the moment.

### Why I use colorblind mode

I am trying out the colorblind visual mode on GitHub. I am not colorblind myself, but I know people who are. It isn't too much of a difference from normal usage, so I have left it on for convenience to people who are red and green colorblind. It is nice to have a change of colors, but I still miss the green and red colors from time to time.

On 2021 October 25th during finalization, I accidentally turned off colorblind mode for the days final screenshots.

### Learning boo

I took up the Boo programming language on 2021 October 31st as a way to celebrate Halloween. The language was so similar to Python that I was able to find minor differences and gain quick mastery in the language. I have used the language before, but not to build an actual program. My first Boo program is the project [Halloween assistant](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Halloween-assistant/)

### Learning Perl

#### Compiling a program (Perl 5)

```terminal
$> perl myProgram.pl
$whitespace$ // The programs output from the abover command is shown here
This is my lovely perl program. It is not a pearl.
HELLO WORLD!!!
TOO LOUD!! *Bang* *Bang* *Bang* -\ (kitchen gun)
AWK (awk:programNotFound)GOODBYE... WORLD! *collapses*
```

Here is the 'lovely' program:

```name
myProgram.pl
```

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
print("This is my lovely perl program. It is not a pearl.\n");
print("HELLO WORLD!!!\n");
print("TOO LOUD!! *Bang* *Bang* *Bang* -\ (kitchen gun)\n");
print("AWK (awk:programNotFound)GOODBYE... WORLD! *collapses*\n");
```

**This section was last updated on 2021, Wednesday, October 6th at 12:06 am**

### Hello world

A Perl Hello world program is identical to a hello world program in languages like Python.

```perl
print ("Hello world")
```

**This section was last updated on 2021, Thursday, November 11th at 6:07 pm**

### Comments

```perl
# This is a comment
""" Block comment
This is a block comment
"""
''' Block comment B
This is also a block comment
'''
```

As far as I can tell, Perl only supports pound sign single line comments and quote block comments. I tested `/*` `//` `/` `///` `\` `\\` `\\\` `(*` `%` `%%` `%%%` `;` and `;;` but had no success

### Learning Prolog

#### 2021 Basic syntax (prolog)

Testing basic syntax of Prolog

```prolog
% Start of script
% The main script for the Kiri voice assistant
% Read from primary libraries
read from "///kiri/LIBraries/voice-commands/1/", nl.
read from "///kiri/LIBraries/ENGINE.pl", nl.
% Main
?- write('Hello, what can I help you with?'), nl.
wait for response, nl.
if no response in 10, nl.
  exit, nl.
  break, nl.
else, nl.
break, nl.
?-
% File info
% File type: Prolog source file (*.pl) Not to be confused with Perl/Raku
% File version: 1 (Monday, 2021 September 27th at 6:03 pm)
% Line count (including blank lines and compiler line): 21

% End of script
```

This is source code from the main thread of V1 of the [Kiri](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Kiri/) project, which is part of the [WacOS Operating system project](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/Kiri/) this script likely does not work at all, it worked very poorly for me, as the syntax kept changing from Perl to Prolog and Prolog to Perl, and I couldn't get the language down due to the confusion. - 2021 Monday, September 27th

**This section was last updated on 2021, Tuesday, October 5th at 12:19 am**

#### Comments in Prolog

These are comments in Prolog.

```prolog
% This is a comment
```

#### Break keyword in Prolog

```prolog
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### File extension problem

Prolog and Perl both share the *.pl file extension. This didn't work out too well with me recently, and I have decided upon changing my Prolog files to the *.pro file extension supplied by Prolog. - 2021 September 29th

### GitHub colorblind awareness day (2021 September 29th)

Today, I got to test GitHubs new UI features, such as a mode for colorblind people. I myself am not colorblind, but @inverno4 is along with the rest of the 8% of colorblind people in the world. I hope that this improvement can make it easier for people to get the most out of the world. It is also nice to go from green to blue, and red to brown for a while (may be permanent) it is still a beta feature, so there is still a lot to change. I honestly thought a lot more would change, but as said earlier, the only things I can find are the transition from green to blue and from red to brown, the GitHUb Linguist being an exception to this.

### DuckDuckGo and the environment

On 2021 September 22nd, [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) announced that they had gone carbon negative, which is very good for the environment. DuckDuckGo is now one of the few major companies that implemented change (Google, Amazon, and others are still far behind) along with this, DuckDuckGo changed their interface to include several new icons and layouts. I think this was done to ease the switch for Google users.

Great job DuckDuckGo!

_I have temporarily changed my wallpaper to the announcement banner to celebrate this_

### GitDrive project

I have been working on generating ideas for improving my hard drive system lately, I intend to start accumulating more data soon, and I want to fix a common problem: duplication.

I am considering getting Git to run off an external hard drive to manage my files, but I don't know how I am going to do it. It is estimated to save about 4.5-6.6 terabytes of memory if done successfully. I still plan on getting a large hard drive for a project that shall not be named concurrently.

**This section was last updated on 2021, Wednesday, September 22nd at 11:01 pm**

### Why do you make so many README files?

Documentation is important. Since README files automatically render a preview on GitHub without navigating to individual files, they are useful in displaying info on the current folder/directory or the project as a whole. I have created at least 10000 README files to date (as of 2021, Tuesday October 12th at 9:45 pm)

**This section was last updated on 2021, Tuesday, October 12th at 9:45 pm**

### Dropping the word `NOTICE` from commit descriptions

Ever since it was pointed out on 2021 September 8th about possible syntax errors with the phrase `NOTICE - Didn't <action>` I have been thinking about it from time to time. On 2021 October 12th, I thought about it a lot, and decided that these may be too annoying for something insignificant (it is insignificant when it is a daily thing) instead, I plan to continue what I am switching to, which is to replace with `README.<fileExtension> - Didn't <action>` / `README.<fileExtension> - <phrase>` or simply `README.<fileExtension>`

I have been working on a project that is requiring a competitive action. Since it would be much more difficult and time consuming to automate the process, I am doing it manually. Due to this, I don't want to focus on each individual commit when they all have the same description. I try not to spend more than 45 seconds per commit in this sub-project. As such, grammatical errors are being made and they are going unfixed. They are becoming common. Sometimes, quantity > quality is a good thing.

### Media

#### Khan Academy

##### Biology

The Crash Course Biology video: `The digestive¬†system` needs to be rewatched at some point, as I hardly paid attention to it today, I was too distracted. These are really good videos and worth watching. - 2021 October 26th

Other crash course videos needing to be rewatched:

`Big Guns: The Muscular System`

`Your immune system: Natural born killer`

### WikiPDF project

I don't know if I have ever mentioned this project by name, but earlier this year (in the summer of 2021) I started a small side project that I dubbed `WikiPDF` which is an offline archive of every Wikipedia article I have ever read, in PDF format. The project was fairly successful, and is still going to this day. It sits at about ~98% completion.

It is nice to have when I don't want to open a web browser, or need a reference on a car trip, or the likes. It is also just nice to have a curated system of articles I can read.

### My APK nightmare

I feel like I should mention this somewhere, I just didn't get to it until today. When I got my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, I went on an installation frenzy, and along with my backed up data, I sideloaded every app that [Inverno4](https://github.com/inverno4/) has downloaded, resulting in over 1300 apps being installed. It has not yet been logged in my OS data project, but it is a pretty crazy endeavor

Recently, I have noted that ads are triggering apps to open, which is frustrating. That is also why I had to bring this up again.

Projects that need update related to this issue:

### Username hijacking

I have recently learned (on 2021 Monday, September 13th) that username hijacking is a much more serious problem than originally imagined. It doesn't have enough security involved to it, meaning anyone from around the world can start blackmailing you and sending dangers your way if you don't give them your username, as usernames can sell for thousands of dollars. The fact that your ISP/Cellular data provider(s) can give in to the demands and give your account to others is a serious threat. I am now more in support of companies banning the accounts of users who use a purchased account, I hope it can become more widespread to discourage the act. I am more concerned about the ISP having so much power here, they already control so much. People have been traumatized to death over a username.

This is a problem that needs to be addressed. I feel like cybersquatting is far less severe than this (I mentioned cybersquatting, as it is somewhat similar)

### GitHub Wiki

I have been using Wikis since month 1 of GitHub, and I have recently got into them again at a much greater extent. I have been working heavily on the Wiki for WacOS this week, creating 50 articles (as of 2021 Saturday, September 18th at 7:26 pm) so far, with hundreds more to go. However, I have come across a major roadblock to this:

There is not enough control over who can edit.

I already manage so much work, I can't manage a Wiki on every project as well. The problem is that GitHub has no protections for Wikis for projects with collaborators, as I can restrict editing for non-collaborators, but I can't control who else can work on the Wiki. I can't trust collaborators on projects with Wikis, no matter how good of a person they are, as their accounts can still be hijacked, and someone can come in and hide bad things into the Wikis and do other types of vandalism. I don't want a GitHub marketplace bot to help me with this, as if the bot goes down, then the vandalism starts.

I am going to start writing guidelines at some point, but I also need a better way of enforcement. I don't want WacOS development to stall due to this, I archive my Wikis already, but it isn't enough. There needs to be more control.

As of 2021 September 23rd, there are over 5000 articles in the archive, across over 3000 sub-folders.

### User-programmer etiquette

This is a list for etiquette between software developers and their users, to ease some common frustrations. I am working on exporting this section.

NEVER call a programmer/game developer "lazy" while they are developing a functional product for you, people who don't develop software don't know what it is like to develop it, it really isn't as easy as you think (even programmers like YandereDev should be respected for this, as over 6 years to develop a massive 3D game **by yourself**, no matter how many if/else statements are used is no easy feat, although criticism is still allowed, obviously)

> I have noted that in the software community, game developers **absolutely hate** being called lazy under these circumstances, and I wanted to clear this up

### Yearly purge

I am planning for the yearly purge of `IGNORE.md` files, which I plan to do from 2022 January 1st to 2022 January 14th. I did it earlier this year twice now, however there is going to be added difficulty in 2022, because my project `SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub` has over 2500 `IGNORE.md` files needing to be deleted.

Here are some of my plans:

Plans for deleting the 2000+ IGNORE.md files in SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub

Delete half a month (~225 files) per day for the first 25 days of January (~5625 files)

Publish releases every day for the first 14 days

### V8 series of templates

I am planning for version 8 of my series of Git templates for quick project setup (for personal and public use) currently, I have the following changes proposed:

V8 Template

1. Too much disclaimer, try to find out how to do a dropdown (without turning the entire page into a giant text box) or comment some of it out for now Œª

2. Mobile version: success, no improvements needed (other than maybe a way to ease navigation and tell where to scroll) Œª

3. Repo directory, for description, tags, linked, and url (if none provided, use the "no description websites or URLs provided" that GitHub uses)

4. UTF-7 clarification

5. Swisscows support

6. Safe.duckduckgo support

7. Removal of parantheses in title line

8. Highly advanced .gitattributes, .editorconfig, and .gitignore

9. Google link (but it actually points to DeGoogle, don't be a jerk about it, just call it DeGoogle)

10. Try to find a way to highlight more text or some other catchy way for important info, also clarify what is important Œª

11. Bold the text for the file info section headings, and file history section with bold, add support for MIME *.mkd and *.markdown

12. HYBRID TEMPLATE: Mix of GitHub (pages) and Git (repository (normal))

Even better improvement:

THE ULTIMATE GIT TEMPLATE:

13. Separate branches for each template category, fit all your templates into one

<!--IMPORTANT TODO Add instructions for branching out and usage of the template TODO!-->

Labels marked with a Lambda Œª were taken from a recent private beta testing

### License agreement

Say goodbye to the [War and Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace) length terms of service associated with other companies (I am not saying War and Peace is a bad book, I am saying it is absurd for a license agreement to be that long) the majority of my software is licensed under a single license (GNU General Public License V3) unfortunately, a few dozen projects require the use of the Apache or MIT licenses, but they are incredibly short and are compatible with each other.

* [If you don't already have a copy of the GNU GPL3 license, you can get it here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

* [Some projects also require the Apache 2.0 license, you can get it here](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

### Privacy compliance

My software is compliant with the following privacy standards:

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Europe) - I plan to be compliant, but I am not verified with this yet legally

California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (North America) - I plan to be compliant, but I am not verified with this yet legally

<!-- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) (North America) - This may not be privacy related !-->

### The direction of this status file

At the moment, I am giving opinions and updates on my status file, this has increased recently, and I was inspired by the [Stallman.org](https://stallman.org/) website to do this. I will eventually copy these over somewhere else where I see fitting.

### Crypto space experiment

I have recently come up with an idea for a possible solution to the cryptocurrency mining environmental problem, which is by mining crypto completely outside of the Earths atmosphere. Although expensive, it would work and help our planet. I am still doing research on the idea, if anyone is capable of sending a $10,000 computer in a spaceship into space, go ahead and report back. It would be best to research the possibilities first (such as if a computer can operate in space as well as it can on Earth, and if it fully prevents Greenhouse gases from affecting us)

### The problem with password managers

I have been meaning to mention this for a while, but I have noted that password managers are a major security risk, and I am really confused as to why so many companies still develop them.

The main problem I have with them is them is that if you use a password manager, you are practically giving everything you use a single password. Say you have logins for over 100 sites. You obviously won't be able to easily remember these, you should write them down in a secure place, but using a password manager takes your 100 passwords and makes it just 1 password. You are trusting your password manager more than 100 sites, and if your password manager is compromised, 100 sites are compromised, rather than just each site that gets breached (It is far less likely that 100 websites will be breached in the time that 1 program is breached)

This is why I don't use password managers. If there is more to this, please let me know. I want to know the reasoning behind why people still develop them. <!-- No, I am not using this as a way to get someone to talk to me on GitHub, but if anyone has anything to say, please do. I hate being in silence for months on end !-->

### Software I am not developing

There are certain types of software I have done research on and decided not to develop, they include:

* Spyware (Because spyware is really bad)

* Ransomware (Because spyware is really bad, and completely pointless to develop, as it has no long term use)

* Password managers (They are a major security problem, see above)

* Security camera software (I can develop cameras, but not security cameras, as I don't want to contribute to mass surveillance)

* Vehicle firmware/operating systems (such as for Toyota trucks, Subaru cars, and so on) I thought hard on this, and decided not to develop for this platform. Someone else will need to make an open source solution for vehicles.

I still develop malware, as I see malware as a form of art; although I have made recent changes to further ensure that it stays inside a virtual machine, with something I call "pro-VM source code" that makes sure it is running in a virtual machine. I don't consider this to be anti-VM code, and I will work on preventing it from becoming that. Originally, I just trusted users to follow the 1 instruction of not running it on their main computer and give plenty of warning first, but I decided to make it safer just in case

### The future of advertising

I have been studying the current problem with TV advertisements for a while, and I have noted that the biggest problem is that it is only corporations, large companies, and con artists that are advertising. Google and McDonald‚Äôs don‚Äôt need to be advertising, as who doesn‚Äôt know what a McDonald‚Äôs is? Less than 20% of the world population doesn't know, and even then, the people that still don‚Äôt know likely don‚Äôt have access to see or hear the ad, as it is not broadcast in their country, they don‚Äôt care, or can‚Äôt hear/see it due to a disability. Google is also an evil company that is so well known that their name is in common use across various languages as its own word. Google already is too much of a monopoly. The problem is that we are not letting smaller people on, and we don‚Äôt have a quality control system to let newer ideas grow, instead of spreading ideas that are copied or repeated. Google is not an innovative company anymore, they only care about competition and money, their ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù are only in response to other people doing the exact same thing that they copy (take YouTube shorts for example, that is just a shameless ripoff of the TikTok format, which likely also came from somewhere else) we need to let smaller new faces show up, people who actually deserve their name to be heard on the silver screen.

The other major problem I noted is the lack of diversity in what is advertised on most channels, it seems like the same ads are just on repeat for a month on most channels, I will be using several channels as an example: they only fall under 6 to 7 categories, no more. The categories include: pharmacy, insurance, Google/Facebook evilness, Spectrum, Spectrum, Spectrum, Spectrum, Spectrum, Spectrum (seriously, Spectrum, we are stuck with your services under your monopoly in my city, you don't need to rub it in 4 times every commercial break) new phones that cost over 4x the price of a working used car that will go in a landfill in 3 months to 4 years (Samsung, Apple, and Google (again)) and culinary (when not counting businesses: Political and election ads)

We need to let smaller companies advertise, but also have better moderation so it doesn't end up with Google ads, where abuse, porn, scams, and clickbait litter the mass so much that you don't see anything else 99.8% of the time. Again, we need to create a controversy regarding Googles lack of moderation on their ads, if most people knew what was actually being advertised (especially on kids games, where porn and torture videos are being advertised) they would freak the fuck out, and it would cause a pretty big controversy. I am making a rare usage of the F word because this is a big fucking deal.

### Software preservation

#### iPod (2001)

Recently (in the past week) a software archivist found an iPod that still had the original iPod firmware on it and uploaded it to the Internet. After 20 years, we finally have a copy of the original iPod firmware (I am not talking about the iPod Touch, I am talking about its predecessor)

#### iOS 6

If anyone knows how to get iOS 6 in a virtual machine with the firmware and operating system, let me know.

### YouTube-DL Legacy

It has been pointed out to me that YouTube-DL development has stalled significantly. It hasn't been updated since June 30th 2021, nearly 2 whole months. YouTube-DL has been incredibly helpful to the world, and it has faced significant opposition by evil forces (such as the RIAA and other 3-4 letter corps) and I hate to see it go. I don't want its legacy to be in vein, and I don't want to just replace it with another downloader, but I might end up having to, as YouTube and other restrictive sites will eventually update their systems to the point that an update to YouTube-DL is required for continued circumvention. So far, it is still working, and there are lots of spinoff projects. If anyone can contact the maintainers of the project and get info on how they are doing so, I encourage you to try. I heard that one of the maintainers was last seen editing Wikipedia on August 23rd 2021.

### Firefox loses 50 million users

So recently, Firefox lost 50 million of its users. I am pretty sure one major part of this was due to Mozilla not listening to their users and doing stupid things like adding Proton Tabs, which the majority of users (including me) hated. It is why I still running Firefox 88.0.1 and haven't gone on to 89.0 or later versions.

I plan to stick with Firefox as long as I can, until a good competitor comes out, but it will still be sad to see it go. I currently have my eyes on Konquerer, DotBrowser, DuckDuckGo browser, and Tor. There aren't enough good alternatives to Chromium, and until more are available, I will continue to support Gecko based browsers and other non-Chromium browsers.

Non-Chromium alternatives to Firefox so far (As of August 24th 2021, highly incomplete)

* Basilisk (Windows only)

* Comodo IceDragon (Windows only)

* Dot Browser [View on GitHub](https://github.com/dothq/browser)

* DuckDuckGo browser (Currently only Android and iOS are supported)

* Konquerer

* Pale Moon

* Tor (breaks most websites completely, due to lots of websites using non-standard features (violation of WHATWG standards for these websites, NOT TOR))

* Waterfox

### Install file problem

I have been experimenting with special files `authors` `credits` `copying` `install` `makefile` in my projects and have had recent difficulty with `install` as it is not working with GitHub pages and crashes in 0 seconds with an unspecified error. I had to widdle the problem down to this file originally, as I had to figure out which of the 7 (now 8) new files are causing the problem. - August 23rd 2021

I have noted that GitHub doesn't like the contents of the file, because no matter what I name it (`INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE` `INTSTALL` `iSTALL` and `HOWTO`) all result in a page build error. I am still looking into the problem. - August 24th 2021

### Security reports

I have noted that several countries (such as the United States and China) have began adopting a social credit system (The US is in the process of doing so) it is a major threat to user privacy, but I found a way to bring the economy down overnight and destroy the social credit system in the process:

Since this system does not like when people search for certain things and will lower your credit score by doing so, you can completely destroy your credit by searching for a ton of things that would give red flags. All it takes is a search history destroyer targetted towards millions of people, and it will destroy the credit of all these people, and would simultaneously crash the credit system overnight. I don't have the hacking skills to do it, but I know someone is going to attempt it. It is an unfair system, which is why I am disclosing this zero day vulnerability without warning.

The people in charge of this have 2 options after this possible attack happens:

Reverse the decision and attempt to salvage peoples credit (the good option, although you will have already taken significant damage)

Ignore the attacks, continue the system, and deal with economic downturn (the bad option, may cause a 2nd great depression)

### Date change

On 2022, January 1st, I will be completely switching my date format from `MM-DD-YYYY` to `YYYY-MM-DD`, in compliance with [ISO:8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) I have been doing this in a semi-fashion since month 1 on GitHub (you can see this in directory paths, as I have been doing it like `YYYY-MM-DD` (example: `/2021/08_August/11/`) the entire time, so this will be unchanged) and after a week of decision (August 4th 2021 to August 11th 2021) I have decided to make the switch everywhere, starting next year.

It is a very simple change, and as of August 12th 2021, I have already began to try and practice doing it, but it is still a bit difficult. Arch Linux's version numbers will be a support method for me, as it is in that format already. I didn't think it was going to be this difficult, all I have to do is switch the year piece from the end to the beginning of the wordnum block.

#### Why January 1st

I decided that it is most appropriate to make this change on the first day of the year, as to prevent errors with dates in the current year, as with the format being switched to, duplication/bad date errors can occur. I also need time to prepare for this change. The decision will go live on 2022, January 1st at 12:00:00:0000 am.

#### Learn more

Here is some information from the ISO website:

##### What can ISO 8601 do for me?

When dates are represented with numbers they can be interpreted in different ways. For example, 01/05/12 could mean January 5, 2012, or May 1, 2012. On an individual level this uncertainty can be very frustrating, in a business context it can be very expensive. Organizing meetings and deliveries, writing contracts and buying airplane tickets can be very difficult when the date is unclear.

ISO 8601 tackles this uncertainty by setting out an internationally agreed way to represent dates:

`YYYY-MM-DD`

For example, September 27, 2012 is represented as 2012-09-27.

ISO 8601 can be used by anyone who wants to use a standardized way of presenting:

* Date

* Time of day

* Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

* Local time with offset to UTC

* Date and time

* Time intervals

* Recurring time intervals

### Planning for my next laptop (2021 edition)

I began planning for my next laptop last night, as I need to start getting more prepared for the next system.

I am really considering giving my next laptop 32 gigabytes of RAM to keep up with what I am doing, and maybe get my desired workflow (up to 5-12 Firefox browser windows open at once all the time, being able to load 2000x25000 resolution images with ease, not having to constantly close programs to free SWAP, being able to have several LibreOffice documents open at once without having to worry about SWAP, maybe some virtual machines, etc.)

I am also considering a decatohecto (16, if the word isn't definied, use duo-octo) core processor, a 2 terabyte SSD, USB ports, the device will be heavier, good battery life, Ubuntu may be swapped with another Linux distribution, but I am really going to try and go for KDE this time, as I learned my lesson with not switching from GNOME on day 1 and deeming it acceptable.

I may wait for the semiconductor shortage to end first, if it is not improved in 1-2 years, I will get the new device anyways

Screen resolution: minimum: 1920x1080, may try for: 2560x1440 or higher

Refresh rate: minimum: 60 hz, may try for: whatever is available and cheap enough, may just stick with 60hz (60 fps)

Color type: minimum: 24 bit color, may try for: whatever is available and cheap enough, may go for 32 bit color to see what it is like

Processor type: AMD, Intel, or whatever I feel comfortable with, most likely will be AMD or Intel, obviously will be x64

Operating system: Definitely Linux, although I am still deciding if I want to stick with Ubuntu

Battery: still trying to find the amp hours of my current laptop, although I have found that my current device is 51 Watt Hours, which is a completely different measurement of power. Whatever I have now for amp hours, I plan to have at least double of that on my next laptop (aiming for triple or quadruple)

Keyboard: MUST be mechanical, or capable of being replaced with a mechanical keyboard. Also obviously must be US QWERTY layout, although I will be accepting of any Latin-based keyboard, including Icelandic (although it is unlikely that I will get anything other than English (US) (QWERTY)) I also need a function (`fn`) key (specifying this, as not all keyboards have this)

I may have given a poor definition of mechanical keyboard/not used the right term. I think I am referring to a metallic durable keyboard, I am told this might be just called "metal keyboard" but I feel like I am looking for a mechanical keyboard. - August 18th 2021

For mechanical keyboard durability, Razor seems to be the best brand. Compared to the usual 50 million clicks per key on other mechanical keyboards, Razor keyboards supposedly give 60 million clicks. I was a bit disappointed that the failure rate was still this high, but at least it is easy to replace. My estimate from a 106 key keyboard is if every key was a character key, you could type 63.6 gigabytes of plain text without copy and pasting into a document before every single key broke. Unfortunately, this scenario is not possible. - 2021 September 17th

I am going to need to factor in CPU fan durability, I never expected my fan to go out in the 1st year and a half. - 2021 September 19th

#### Planning for my next denetbook

I have plans to get a super cheap computer used for basic file transfers for highly confidential information (such as passwords) I am not looking to go too far with this, I will accept any computer that was created prior to the year 2003, provided:

1. It can run Linux or FreeBSD (or any other flavor of BSD/another open source system, I am not picky, as long as the operating system is open source) (bonus if it comes pre-installed)

2. It costs less than US$20.00 (I won't spend $20.01 or more on this device, as it is meant to be a very basic device)

3. It has at least 512 megabytes of storage (solid state not required, although it would be nice to have)

4. It is completely barred from connecting to the Internet (including Wi-Fi, LAN, BBS, BlueTooth, and any other digital connection)

5. It has support for USB 2 or higher, with at least 1 port (even if I have to use a dongle to get it to work)

This has been a plan for quite some time, I just didn't lay the groundwork for it until today. I am calling it the `denetbook` (de-net(work) book) as it is the opposite of a netbook.

### Possible keyboard issues arise (2021 August 17th)

Less than 3 months after my gruesome laptop breakdown period after replacing my keyboard and getting my operating system wiped, my keyboard is already starting to show signs of problems again. It has only been `89` days since the repair, and I still haven't fully recovered from the last incident. Leave it to me to wear out a brand new keyboard in less than 3 months, I am for sure switching to a mechanical keyboard from now on, no matter how difficult it is to get a good laptop with one.

|>~&~&~&~>                                                                                                                                                     |        |  %                                                                                                                                                           %
   %                                                                                                                                                           %
   \%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/

I have not entirely confirmed it yet, but it is showing signs of problems with 2 keys `d` and `n` - August 17th 2021

The issue is getting worse, and now 6 keys are having problems: `d` `n` `,` `rshift` `lctrl` and `i` - August 18th 2021

The keyboard has gotten a lot better starting last night. - August 19th 2021

No issues. - August 20th to August 24th 2021

The keyboard is starting to feel like it is breaking again, although the keys work somewhat OK. - August 25th 2021 to August 26th 2021

The keyboard has become much more responsive again, and is giving less issue, although I really can see the lights under the `D` and `S` keys more than I should - August 27th 2021 to August 28th 2021

The spacebar started having issues in the past week, and it has been getting worse. - 2021 September 13th to 2021 September 17th

The space key is doing much better today, it has only had an issue a few times. - 2021 September 18th

The space key was performing perfectly today, although another issue seemed to take its place. - 2021 September 19th

### Swisscows

I have discovered the Swisscows open source privacy based search engine today, it has some relatively good reviews in the privacy community, although I still like DuckDuckGo better, as DuckDuckGo has a better UI to me. It is still a very good resource to have, every good private search engine is a major contribution to the world.

### COVID-19 pandemic

This chapter is going to be moved to [code-distancing](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/) eventually.

As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic started in December 2019, and is still ongoing, as of August 19th 2021. Misinformation has played a major role in increasing the mortality of the virus, as many people in many countries are refusing to get vaccinated due to conspiracy theories, general misinformation, cult beliefs, and general hesitancy. I am keeping this section here to inform people with basic helpful information about the virus, as every person I reach out to can save multiple lives (1 person learning can spread to more people, thus resulting in fewer cases with more vaccination) I know I have a small voice, but I feel like I need to do my part, everybody does (unless you are spreading misinformation, then please, JUST STOP!!!)

I am aware that the pandemic has become very politicized globally, and that there are many crackdowns across various social media sites. Due to my political containment policy, I will not be talking politically here, and I want to remind you that the health of a species is not and should not be based on party/partisan poltiics. I am aware that there is a risk to posting about COVID-19 due to crackdowns, but it is a risk I am willing to take, and you should take as well. I already started the [code distancing](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-Distancing/) project, which gives more information related to the pandemic, so this isn't my first time talking about this publicly.

#### Privacy

I am on my way to becoming a privacy advocate. I can 100% guarantee you that there are **NO** microchips in a COVID-19 vaccine, this is a popular conspiracy theory that I felt the need to debunk right away. While I am at it, 5G Internet/data connections will not give you diseases or severe defects, that is not how cellular networks work. Most of the people who believe this stuff likely have a phone in their pocket that may/may not have 5G functionality. The same controversy happened with 2G, 3G, and 4G, it just wasn't as well noticed by the general public.

#### How to get a vaccine painlessly

A lot of people fear the needle of a vaccine, even if they aren't hesistant towards vaccines in other ways. I can assure you that most doctors and nurses administering the vaccine really know what they are doing and are very careful. I have some advice for you that helped me:

* Don't look at the needle: before you get the shot, look to the left (or to the right, it is your preference) until you feel a tiny shock. Doing this, the receival of the vaccine will be almost entirely painless. You will feel a small sting, but it is a lot better than the fear of looking at the needle as it is going in. When I was younger, I used to scream while receiving the vaccine (sorry to anybody I upset by doing this back then) recently, I learnt this trick, and it has worked really well.

Yes, you may be sore afterwards, but the soreness isn't very painful at all, and most likely will not prevent you from doing day-to-day activities. It is better than dying a horrible, gruesome, lonely death on a ventilater without being able to see anyone, it is truly a horrible, horrible way to die. I would list it as one of the top 3 worst possible ways to die.

#### Getting a 3rd shot

Starting in September, people who had their first 2 vaccines will be capable of getting a 3rd shot, known as a booster shot. You made it to this point, remember that there are lots of people who won't even get their first shot yet. People can change, more will be joining us shortly.

It is highly recommended to get your booster shot when you can, it is available to you 8 months after your second shot, which comes 2 weeks after your first shot.

#### Airliners

There have been lots of incidents on airplanes and other public transit of people freaking out and using domestic abuse over mask mandates, and now it is resulting in people receiving fines between $40,000.00 and $500,000.00. Don't be an ahole, just comply. It is ridiculous that so many people would rather have a half million dollar fine, than a completely free vaccine.

#### Alternative treatment

The vaccine is the only treatment method to this pandemic, you shouldn't trust social media for alternative treatments, especially Facebook (since they seem to be the home for most of the disinformation now)

I have recently learned of an increase in demand for horse dewormer as a cure for COVID-19 and it is very obvious it is not a cure. The people who die from it likely aren't on GitHub, they are practically committing suicide if they attempt this. Just let nature take its course. Natural selection.

I honestly want to see the numbers for how many purchases of de-wormer are being made compared to normal, mostly out of curiosity, and partly due to wanting to be more disappointed in humanity. Please note that some people buy de-wormer for the correct purpose, since I live on a farm, it is needed every so often for our animals. You are not a wild animal, you are a functional human being.

#### Losing your job

Don't be a complete idiot and turn down your 6 figure ($100,000.00+/year) job (or any job in general) over refusal to take a 0 figure ($0.00) vaccine. Just get vaccinated. If you still believe Microchips are in the vaccine and no-one can convince you otherwise, remember that there is a massive world chip shortage, so if that was the case, they wouldn't do it anyways. It is likely you have a cellular device in your pocket anyways that already is tracking you. Plus, you have been getting vaccines for everything else anyways. This isn't something completely new, inoculation has been a standard for over 200 years.

#### Humor

Some common humor regarding the pandemic:

```shell
stay at 127.0.0.1
wear a 255.255.255.0
```

<details><summary><H5>Context/spoil the joke</H5></summary>

`127.0.0.1` in networking is the number for your `HOME` network

`255.255.255.0` in networking simply translates to a network `mask` but this is not the only version of the mask, it can be other numbers as well.

</details>

#### Sources

I will add sources in the future, although some of this content cannot be sourced, as it is original research (such as the "how to get a vaccine painlessly" section)

Stay safe!

Source1: my dad (registered Nurse, Fire commissioner since 2016, and long-time Firefighter, a very funny and kind man)

### GitHub and Scratch

Ever since Wednesday, 2021 August 11th, I have recently started to get nostalgia for Scratch again. I have now noted that the GitHub community really reminds me of Scratch (to be more clear, it is similar to a much more advanced version of "scratch" with strong community style nostalgia) there is something about programmers getting together and programming together that gives off this really good vibe.

### Express yourself

I am using Social Media and the Internet the way it should be, uncensored talks and about the creator, and not about a company (like the Internet used to be like partially before 2007) I am working on bringing a comeback to the non-corporate Internet, without the norm of people touting misinformation and other bullshit.

### Android screenshot problem (possibly defective S20 screen)

I have been meaning to mention this for a while, but my cellular device has been having an on and off problem for over a month now, where a certain screenshot I take every once in a while (and the 0-6 screenshots after it) will not hide the screenshot preview until it fully expires (this process can‚Äôt be rushed) and afterwards, the problem by this screenshot lag will either cause the phone to become unresponsive until you turn off the screen or let you continue but have all buttons break and zooming to become completely broken and forced. The fix to this is to minimize and maximize the current app, then turn the phone off and turn it back on and quickly minimize and maximize the app. It it tedious as hell. It started in July 2021.

### Lowering my expectations

My mind recently messed up a little bit when I failed to work on 25 different repositories for 3 days in a row, and also getting 200 commits. These expectations are being removed, and being replaced with a "whatver I can do comfortably" amount. This was an issue on July 16th 2021, but as of July 20th 2021, I have recovered.

This was part of a down period, another down period occurred less than 6 days later and was much worse. Since then (as of August 17th 2021) it has gotten much better, thanks to the lowering of ridiculous expectations. I still reach them every once in a while, just not every day

#### Tribute to Dennis Ritchie

This section is rarely updated, and its data does not currently reflect subsequent updates.

I did not work on the Tribute project to Dennis Ritchie today. Updates are waiting for his posthumous birthday on September 9th (the next occurence being September 9th 2022, in `354` days from today (This section was last updated on 2021 September 20th at 11:17 pm)

<!-- TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO !-->
<! UPDATE ON SEPTEMBER 9TH 2021 !>
<!-- TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO !-->

Tomorrow, I will be working on my tribute to the late [Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) (as tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of his passing[1](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna44910730) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/technology/dennis-ritchie-programming-trailblazer-dies-at-70.html) [3](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15287391) [4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/dennis-ritchie-founder-of-unix-and-c-dies-at-70/2011/10/13/gIQAXsVXiL_story.html) [5](https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dennis-ritchie-20111014-story.html) [6](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/13/dennis-ritchie) [7](https://www.cnet.com/news/dennis-ritchie-father-of-c-programming-language-dies/) [8](https://www.wired.com/2011/10/dennis-ritchie/)) he never really was a household name, but he is still someone worth talking about. It is still frustrating that Steve Jobs died in the same month as him, as so many people went to mourn Steve Jobs while hardly anyone went to mourn Dennis Ritchie, you know, creator of the C programming language that is on practically every computer right now, and the UNIX operating system, which its descendents are used on over 90% of the worlds servers, and on 500 out of 500 of the top 500 supercomputers (yes, all 500 of the top supercomputers run Linux) [1](https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/share/SupercomputersLinux.pdf) [2](https://www.stackscale.com/blog/most-powerful-supercomputers-linux/) [3](https://itsfoss.com/linux-runs-top-supercomputers/) [4](https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-linux-all-the-time-supercomputers-top-500/)

##### Organization work continued

No data available

#### Snapcraft

I have recently started to work on porting my projects to Snapcraft, as an extra install option. Really, the only problem with snapcraft is that the server end is proprietary, the rest of the format is open source. I am still very new to this, and I have no way to actually develop snap programs. I have just been filling out the applications for it.

As part of fearing the rising problem of software as a service, I am going to stop supporting snapcraft at the current degree. I am also going to lessen my support for services, and promote ownership of products. I am also going to start fighting planned obsolescence harder, as it is a real problem environmentally, and societally.

[Gizmodo link](https://gizmodo.com/in-2030-you-wont-own-any-gadgets-1847176540) I have other research to support this issue, but there are too many to list here. I will list the full problem below.

#### Phases of the year (2020)

<!-- This section is incomplete. !-->

For my first year of GitHub, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml
January: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
February: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
March: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
April: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
May: the start of seanpm2001/Joining GitHub
June: the very basics of Git, SNU replatforming
July: Getting comfortable with Git and GitHub, July 9th, dawn of the Linux era
August: The rise of git-image, commits en masse.
September: The start of GitHub organizations
October: Average month, code distancing, and the continuing rise of git-image projects
November: Mass archival, mass projects, and first (failed) submission work
December: Wrapping up the year and the rise of the project language file, Meadows going online
```

#### Phases of the year (2021)

For this year, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml
January: Year preparation
February: Degoogle 2021
March: Discussion and code distancing
April: The race to join 100 commits each era/untitled month
May: GitHub platform month, organization documentation and creation celebration and acceleration
June: Robotics month, and GitHub organization documentation finalization, and Gist revival, the dawn of the GitHub pages era, web 2.0.1
July: Linux celebration month, GitHub pages era part II
August: Renovations month
September: Quantum Meadows Autumn (QMA) Medical awareness month, Wiki month, WacOS/apple month
October: DeGoogling October, the wiki-ning part 2, dawn of the musical journey
November: Seans musical journey continues, building back to normal, [undefined]
December: Coming soon
```

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 11,500 (11.5K) stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"""notice:"""

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is how you do so:

"""how"""

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

"""alternatively"""

# You can go to the projects menu and see the exact amount (if you have access, I haven't tested this with non-seanpm2001 accounts yet)

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from a couple weeks ago was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

Some other recent changes I don't like include:

* 1. Location cannot be customized in organizations or user profiles - June 22nd 2021

* 2. Task lists have circular progress bars now, instead of a rectangular one, with no way to change it back - June 23rd 2021

* 3. The hover text for the commit calendar is now too bloated - July 31st 2021 to August 1st 2021, still ongoing as of August 3rd 2021

* 4. GitHub organizations getting redesigned and losing functionality and look too compact (you can't see how long ago a project was modifed anymore, and you can only see 10 projects at a time, breaking the view, and the sorting options. It wasn't broken Microsoft, why did you bring out the sledgehammer? - This actually really upset me yesterday (August 3rd 2021) but I didn't mention it until today (August 5th 2021)

* 4.1 - Description from August 11th 2021: Crappy layout, no borders, harder to browse and navigate, clunky, not as good, not necessary

* 4.2 - Update: modification times were added back, this is good, but the layout is still bad, and needs an API change. - ~August 9th 2021

* 5. The editor now auto collapses and auto expands while editing files, instead of remaining fixed with a scrollbar - August 11th 2021

> Followup

> This issue was fixed on 2021 September 13th, no more intense CPU spikes!

* 5.1 I am not used to it yet

* 6. The `Code` button shrunk and its icon was removed, thus the feature was de-emphasized, although functionality remains the same... for now. - August 11th 2021

* 7. Performance is getting worse and has been draining my battery (August 26th to August 27th 2021)

* 8. GitHub tag/release publishing got worse, and now requires you to use a dropdown to create the tag, which makes it difficult to do other things or look for information to help you build the tag, it is only getting more locked down. I am tired of all the dropdowns on GitHub (~2021 August 30th)

* 9. [BUG] Since 2021 September 22nd, the sponsor button on every project disappears upon creating, uploading a file, or refreshing the page. The issue has still not been fixed as of 2021 September 23rd.

**What is the 25 project limit**

* GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

I have decided to start listing things I like about GitHub, as I don't want a fully negative experience.

<!-- Make a list of all the things you like about GitHub !-->

* 1. I like the GitHub linguist and its color codes. Ruby in dark mode reminds me of a certain part of my childhood

* 2. There are some skeuomorphic/detailed elements, and it is not all flat and boring. It seems like new skeuomorphic elements are being added (as of July 14th 2021)

* 3. There is some unique dialogue when an error happens, such as "yowsa, thats a lot of files"

* 4. Linux, BSD, MacOS, and other non-Windows support is available, along with support for various browsers. It isn't locked into just Google Chrome, and the site follows WHATWG web standards

* 5. The community is a lot friendlier and more professional (at least 100x) when compared to that of a site like YouTube

* 6. The site does a good job at tracking problems and fixing them

* 7. The site implements the Git version control system well

* 8. README Indexes are really neat, I really liked when they were introduced.

* 9. The site has a dark mode, but the people at GitHub went the extra mile and kept light mode, and even added a dark mode that is slightly dimmed for people who prefer it

* 10. The animation at the homepage is pretty cool, although a bit CPU intensive on Linux (like most other things, as my current computer has a poor GPU)

* 11. The "Secret" username/username repository is a good feature

* 12. August 25th 2021 redesign: the redesign actually made the site better

* 13. 2021 August 27th: A high contrast option was added for Dark mode, it is nice how many features are being added

* 14. Change to GitHub: public, private, public archive labels added to repo, still no option for archived and template at the same time. Not the worst change, but the site is changing so rapidly it is really hard to keep up - 2021 September 8th

* 15. I have been using my GitHub_Organization_Info repo as a reference, it has been really helpful starting yesterday (Tuesday, 2021 September 8th)

* 16. GitHub added this cool new animation for the activity feed while it is loading, a new mona (:octocat:) animation.

* 17. Today, I got to test GitHubs new UI features, such as a mode for colorblind people. I myself am not colorblind, but @inverno4 is along with the rest of the 8% of colorblind people in the world. I hope that this improvement can make it easier for people to get the most out of the world. It is also nice to go from green to blue, and red to brown for a while (may be permanent) it is still a beta feature, so there is still a lot to change. I honestly thought a lot more would change, but as said earlier, the only things I can find are the transition from green to blue and from red to brown, the GitHUb Linguist being an exception to this. - 2021 September 30TH

* 18. There are 6 different visual themes on GitHUb now. Less than a year ago, there was only light mode. I like these changes

* 19. Another smaller but wholesome feature was the introduction of a confetti animation, and a extra-temporary dialob box about creating your first issue/discussuon in a project. I like these new changes. - 2021 September 29th

> Update (2021 September 30th) I recorded a video of the confetti animation and uploaded it to [seanpm2001/seanpm2001/Media/...](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Media/Videos/GitHub/2021/Confetti/GitHub_Confetti_2021September30th_WacOS_Cloud_1080p.webm)

* 20. You can now natively view the source code of a README file without viewing it raw or editing it, and switch back and forth between source code and rich text (noticed in Markdown, previously, I only noticed this in SVG files) - First spotted: 2021 September 28th

* 21. More entries coming soon

Here is a list of things I am neutral on:

* 1. Wiki pages ask if you want to see more pages after it lists the first 15. It will not ask you to see pages 46-60 then 61-75 and so on with further dialog.

* 2. Repository searching through the homepage is a bit clunkier now, as the username turns into a circular icon that is applied to all entries, rather than a link list (first noticed: 2021 September 28th)

#### Summer vacation #1

Ended, back home. See past status updates for more info.

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today. - June 26th 2021

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files on Sunday, June 13th 2021, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

On Monday, June 15th 2021, I tested this trick for MediaWiki, which GitHub recognizes as WikiText. Here is the `.gitattributes` sample file used:

##### WikiText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.wiki linguist-detectable=true
*.wiki linguist-documentation=false
```

Also:

##### YAML Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.yml linguist-detectable=true
*.yml linguist-documentation=false
*.yaml linguist-detectable=true
*.yaml linguist-documentation=false
```

##### ReStructuredText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.rst linguist-detectable=true
*.rst linguist-documentation=false
```

##### WebVTT Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.vtt linguist-detectable=true
*.vtt linguist-documentation=false
```

##### KiXtart Gitattributes (unsuccessful)

```gitattributes
*.kix linguist-detectable=true
*.kix linguist-documentation=false
```

I have not tested any other languages, I am still trying to test .svg .gitattributes .gitignore and .txt

#### Giving ProtonMail a 2nd chance

I am still very upset with ProtonMail, but I have decided to give them a second chance today, and try to work through some issues via movements, and contacting the people at the lovely Switzerland office. I will get into contacts with ProtonMail, and learn this new mess of a UI.

As of 2021 September 19th, I have not tried ProtonMail again since the last login. I am extremely disappointed, as I may have permanently lost contact with a friend due to this.

#### Socializing

**As part of a cleanup process on this status post, entries before 2021 November 9th have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

I made a lot less progress in socializing today. - 2021 November 9th

#### Maintainers

Currently, I am the only maintainer for my GitHub projects. I am looking for new maintainers at the moment. I can't do all this by myself.

I am really looking for maintainers. I will train you myself if needed, but I only want people who enjoy doing it/really want to do it.

Maintenance is needed on my projects. I will get each project ready for maintenance by you or someone else. Please _**@**_ me for the training course.

On June 21st 2021, I made a repository outlining the beginning of my maintainer guidelines. You can view it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Maintainers-info)

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 45+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today. - June 23rd 2021

The todo list has been getting scattered development, most easy and medium tasks are being done, but not large or immersive projects - June 26th 2021

#### Year In Review GitHub Year 1 progress

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I didn't make any progress on this goal today - July 3rd 2021

I haven't made progress on this in months. - July 14th 2021

Still abandoned - July 15th 2021 to August 30th 2021

#### Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries before 2021 November 9th have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

I succeeded in catching up tonight, and I stayed caught up today. - 2021 November 8th to 2021 Novemnber 15th

I failed to catch up on Marine Biology documentation tasks today. - 2021 November 16th

#### The future of TRM

Currently, my brand names have 3 layers

Ancient: TRM (2015-2018) (August 3rd 2021-present)

Medieval: Seanwallawalla (2015-2018) (partially: 2020-present)

Modern: Seanpm2001 (2020-present)

TRM has been mostly abandoned for several years, with the exception of the TRM brand being defined and documented in 2020, and 2021. It has mostly just been a TeamTDM ripoff, and hasn't been used seriously since 2018. I decided to change the acronym today (August 3rd 2021) from:

**T**he

I**r**on

**M**elon

(it has technically just been Tim this whole time)

to:

**T**he

**R**eal

**M**yrick

The name was recommended by my Dad, and is a reference to the metaphor [The Real McCoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_real_McCoy) the original acronym might be archived into the name T-TIM (Team: The Iron Melon)

#### Vexillology work

I have been planning this for a few days, but I now plan on hosting a mirror of the site FOTW.info which is one of the top Vexillology (study of flags) sites. Today, I decided it would be too cumbersome to do by hand every day/week/month, so I have started work on getting the project automated. There is still work to go on this.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Clean slate

Next clean slate is ready on September 1st 2021.

And finally...

Today was a better day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I was wearing down while putting the finishing touches on this status post. I can't go any further today unfortunately. I really want to do more.

#### Miscellaneous notes

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.

I am trying to burn this into my brain, as I forget sometimes when asked about my projects, which is:

"don't ever be afraid to be yourself, as being yourself is all of who you are"

and also:

"if you try to be someone you are not, you will be found out as a fraud in the future"

People don't usually forget this, but I need to give this advice to myself, as I sometimes forget it when asked about what my projects are and what they do.

These status posts are going to be shortened eventually, I am still figuring out how to do so in a clean manner.
