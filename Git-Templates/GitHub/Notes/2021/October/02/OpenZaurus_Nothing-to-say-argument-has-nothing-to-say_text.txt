Daniel J. Solove is a full-time law professor at the George Washington University Law School. This essay is from his new book, Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security, published in May of 2011 by Yale University Press. He introduces possible problems of government information gathering and surveillance that are often overlooked. He had the intention to remind the audience of the importance of privacy.

As, everyone assumes that we are not being monitored, Professor Solove effectively convinces the audience that the “nothing-to-hide” argument doesn’t successfully cover all the problems that arise from the government’s evidence. Solove says the claim “I’ve got nothing to hide” argument, which is so often mentioned in discussions concerning the government’s gathering and examination of our personal information.
