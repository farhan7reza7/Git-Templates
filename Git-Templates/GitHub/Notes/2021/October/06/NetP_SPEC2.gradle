Additional comments: WebP really should not exist in its current state. I am surprised that despite its growing popularity, its lack of improvement, and lack of support, that it is still a growing format. For example, MediaWiki (including all of its Wiki projects, such as Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikidata, etc.) and Eye of GNOME do not support the format at all. Firefox supports it but not too well. It also has known problems, such as being not as effective as the APNG or JPEG in terms of improvements.
