# Welcome to plotholes

This is the place where possible plotholes in the CODEVID-19 story are discussed, and go solved or unsolved. I got a bit creative with this project, I tried, but it may not be perfect.

Please remember that this project is _satire_. I feel like it would be pretty obvious to most people that this project is a big joke, but I have to put a disclaimer.

# Possible plothole: how did all the programming languages get CODEVID-19

These programming languages were code distancing, so how did they get CODEVID-19?

Simple:

These programming languages come into contact with hundreds, thousands, and sometimes millions of programmers daily, some of which tested positive for COVID-19. The programmers can distance from others, but once COVID-19 transfers through the real world to the digital one, it becomes CODEVID-19, and many programmers are unaware of this. Unfortunately, there currently is no fix for this, as the current computer firewalls aren't designed to protect against this, and there are times where firewalls can be a problem. Luckily, code cannot die from CODEVID-19, but it can rot and become inefficient.

***This plothole has been marked as solved.***

Things we learned from the pandemic {
A lot of jobs that claimed couldn't be done from home COULD be done from home
We go through a lot more food than we think we do
A lot of people are not as they seem

Introvert paradise {
COVID-19 is a paradise situation for introverts. Introverts before the pandemic tried to get away from it all, but just couldn't. Now that it is acceptable to wear a mask and dark sunglasses, you hardly have to show your face. There are also less people to communicate with, and it is socially acceptable to stay home for weeks/months on end.

# About the code distancing distancer

The code distancing distancer script is a program in the works that spreads source code of all program files by 6 lines apart to raise COVID-19 awareness.
