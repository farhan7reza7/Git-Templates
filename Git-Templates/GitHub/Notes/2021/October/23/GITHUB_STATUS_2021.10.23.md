Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

Mention: I am using Social Media and the Internet the way it should be, uncensored talks and about the creator, and not about a company (like the Internet used to be like partially before 2007)

I have been meaning to mention this for a while, but my cellular device has been having an on and off problem for over a month now, where a certain screenshot I take every once in a while (and the 0-6 screenshots after it) will not hide the screenshot preview until it fully expires (this process can‚Äôt be rushed) and afterwards, the problem by this screenshot lag will either cause the phone to become unresponsive until you turn off the screen or let you continue but have all buttons break and zooming to become completely broken and forced. The fix to this is to minimize and maximize the current app, then turn the phone off and turn it back on and quickly minimize and maximize the app. It it tedious as hell. It started in July 2021.

I got the normal work done today, but didn't get to unique programming projects as planned. I hope things return to normal later next week.

Wiki guidelines

Problem: GitHub has no protections for Wikis for projects with collaborators, as I can restrict editing for non-collaborators, but I can't control who else can work on the Wiki. I can't trust collaborators on projects with Wikis, no matter how good of a person they are, as their accounts can still be hijacked, and someone can come in and hide bad things into the Wikis and do other types of vandalism. I don't want a GitHub marketplace bot to help me with this, as if the bot goes down, then the vandalism starts.

So for collaborators, there are guidelines for writing Wikis here.

I got enough done today, and I still have plans for tomorrow, including working on the core SNU repository, and my tribute to the late [Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) (as tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of his passing[1](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna44910730) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/technology/dennis-ritchie-programming-trailblazer-dies-at-70.html) [3](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15287391) [4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/dennis-ritchie-founder-of-unix-and-c-dies-at-70/2011/10/13/gIQAXsVXiL_story.html) [5](https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dennis-ritchie-20111014-story.html) [6](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/13/dennis-ritchie) [7](https://www.cnet.com/news/dennis-ritchie-father-of-c-programming-language-dies/) [8](https://www.wired.com/2011/10/dennis-ritchie/)) he never really was a household name, but he is still someone worth talking about. It is still frustrating that Steve Jobs died in the same month as him, as so many people went to mourn Steve Jobs while hardly anyone went to mourn Dennis Ritchie, you know, creator of the C programming language that is on practically every computer right now, and the UNIX operating system, which its descendents are used on over 90% of the worlds servers, and on 500 out of 500 of the top 500 supercomputers (yes, all 500 of the top supercomputers run Linux) [1](https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/share/SupercomputersLinux.pdf) [2](https://www.stackscale.com/blog/most-powerful-supercomputers-linux/) [3](https://itsfoss.com/linux-runs-top-supercomputers/) [4](https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-linux-all-the-time-supercomputers-top-500/) I also plan to keep website development going, as I am making some real progress (7 websites in 2 days) and I am hoping to eventually finish this website project/keep it up to date. I also don't want to rush it, so give me 5 years tops for the current 655.

My battery problem, not hearing anyone else have battery problems:
I am really disappointed in this laptops poor battery life. I saw an image of a laptop that was over an inch thick today, and it made me miss having that. They used to only be able to fit 1-2 hours of battery life into those things, and they can fit 2-4 hours of battery life in ones like the one I have, so why can‚Äôt we just go back to inch thick laptops, but with 24-48+ hour batteries? It is just a really difficult problem with a very easy solution that negatively impacts my life, and most likely other peoples lives as well. However, I have never heard a single other person complain about laptop battery life yet, which I find to be really surprising. I took this passage from my journaling and slightly modified it, as I need to make my voice heard. Having laptops that are just a couple centimeters thick just isn't sustainable if they have to be over 3x more expensive, and have 60x less functionality

I had a good day with development today. Today, I worked on various projects, including the usual daily tasks, work on 3 new organizations, and starting work on a new, very important automation project. I came up with an idea recently, and I finally got to publish it today. The idea is for a secondary mouse pointer, which can be activated when the previous one gets locked inside a virtual machine. This project is a virtual machine tool, and will also not need its own organization.

I did less work today, it was a stressful evening tonight, and I had to process what to do next. The new automation project is highly important, and I estimate that it will save me over 4000 hours of time for 2 years after its creation, and then some. It will also help people with similar workflows.

I was too tired to stay up tonight, and I had to skip Marine Biology, DuckDuckGo, status file, and activity file work.

I am in the adoption process of the GNU philosophy, and I am trying to find my opinion on the "Linux" vs "GNU/Linux" debate.

### The situation with laptop batteries and functionality

I am really disappointed in my current laptops poor battery life. I saw an image of a laptop that was over an inch thick today, and it made me miss having that. They used to only be able to fit 1-2 hours of battery life into those things, and they can fit 2-4 hours of battery life in ones like the one I have, so why can‚Äôt we just go back to inch thick laptops, but with 24-48+ hour batteries? It is just a really difficult problem with a very easy solution that negatively impacts my life, and most likely other peoples lives as well. However, I have never heard a single other person complain about laptop battery life yet, which I find to be really surprising. I took this passage from my journaling and slightly modified it, as I need to make my voice heard. Having laptops that are just a couple centimeters thick just isn't sustainable if they have to be over 3x more expensive, and have 60x less functionality

### Why laptops should become thick again

Laptops should become thick again. This trend of making everything smaller just makes it less functional and more expensive. I lost count of how many times I have made the argument for bigger computers. If I had a 5 pound laptop compared to a ~0.5 pound laptop, I could have such higher functionality, such as not having to use a defective dongle, having a 24+ hour battery life rather than a 2-4 hour battery life, being able to store over 2000 terabytes of data (think this isn't feasible, look no further than the 2 terabyte microSD card that is smaller than a popcorn kernel, now imagine hundreds or thousands of those, it would take up as much space as an external 2 terabyte drive from 2020, but could hold much more) being able to have over a terabyte of RAM, and more. I don't want a Macbook lighter than air, I want a functional computer.

##### Shebang (python)

I learned how to make and use a functional Shebang in Python today, and I learned why most Shebangs are so useful.

Since most scripting languages recognize `#` as the start of a comment, Shebangs work very well with compilers of these languages, as the processor recognizes the shebang as a command, while the scripting language may ignore it and continue running normally. (If I don't have this definition right, please start a discussion about it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/discussions/) this is new knowledge to me, and I am still learning)

Example (using Python 3.6)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3.6
# Normal comment here, shebang above
print ("Hello world")
break
return 0
```

### File extension problem

Prolog and Perl both share the *.pl file extension. This didn't work out too well with me recently, and I have decided upon changing my Prolog files to the *.pro file extension supplied by Prolog. - 2021 September 29th

### Learning Pascal

#### 2021 Basic syntax (prlog)

Testing basic syntax of Pascal

```pascal
{ Start of script }
// Pascal comments are weird
{ This type of comment is even weirder, similar to (* *) in CAML }
program aboutPage(output);
begin
  asm 0101000 10101010 00011000 01101100 { Assembly data? } // I know this line is not functional, take it out upon testing
  write('about:blank')
  write('Lorem ipsum')
  helloWorldOnTwoLines(); { DO NOT USE return }
  break
end.
function helloWorldOnTwoLines();
begin
  write('Hello-')
  continue.
  	write('-world')
  	break; // Semicolons are recognized as null statements and are not needed
  break;
end.

```

I need feedback on any problems with this, this is basically all my Pascal knowledge as of 2021 Friday September 24th

### Learning C

#### 2021 September 22nd Continue keyword pseudocode

Last night, I gave myself an ultimatum on programming practices, and the main goal was to get programming work done, and advance my knowledge of programming. I decided to practice learning C, as I want to focus primarily on C, Python, and C++ (probably not Java though, at least not at the moment) my knowledge of C partially went up today, and my familiarity with it grew. Syntax highlighting has always helped me. I started experimenting with the `continue` keyword, but I am currently only using it for pseudocode purposes, to illustrate what happens after an input is given in a part of the program. Here is an example:

```c
int main(void) {
	printf("Hello");
	continue: { // Pseudocode here (3) and below
		printf(" World");
		break;
	}
}
return main();
goto 1;
return 0;
break;
exit;
```

Notice several other keywords being used. The goto line is just something I wanted to use, it is supposed to go to the first line. The `return 0` is something I recently learned is common in C programs (I also learned something really funny last night, which is that semicolons can be used as tabs/indents, I have the meme on me, but I won't upload it here) the `break;` keyword is just a fancy element, I don't entirely know what it does, I assume it means to stop the current line. Finally, the `exit` keyword is supposed to exit the program, I have noted that it is a recognized word.

There is still lots to improve on. I have been separating WacOS projects into separate sub-projects today, starting with WacWrite, and ending with SirIsaacNewtonScript and SirIsaacNewtonOS. I may do more work on this tomorrow. The WacOS project is getting lots of work this month, especially on its project Wiki, which surpassed 100 pages today. I was going to spend less time on it today, but I really felt like working on it.

#### Hello World (C)

easy.

```c
# include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	printf("Hello World");
}
```

The only part that was difficult was remembering the `# include <stdio.h>` line, which was the only piece of this sample I didn't write. Here is a copy of what I wrote:

```c
int main(void) {
	printf("Hello World");
}
```

**This section was last updated on 2021, Tuesday, October 5th at 12:19 am**

#### Semicolons as indents (C)

I found a funny meme a few days ago about this, I will recreate it in my own way:

```c
# include <stdio.h>
int main(void); {
;;;;printf("Look at my source code");
;;;;continue;{
;;;;;;;;printf("World");
;;;;;;;;printf("Purposefully mixed up and backwards\n");
;;;;;;;;printf("World Hello /':;|;:'\ Hello World\n");
;;;;;;;;break;
;;;;;;;;};
;;;;printf("Hello");
;;;;break;
};
```

Not the best meme, but it is the source of where I got this idea from.

<!-- The meme (if you still don't see it in a future version, please @ me in a comment on a commit with the status post. I seriously still don't have it on me tonight (2021.09.23) as I haven't backed up the data in a few days) !-->

### GitHub colorblind awareness day (2021 September 29th)

Today, I got to test GitHubs new UI features, such as a mode for colorblind people. I myself am not colorblind, but @inverno4 is along with the rest of the 8% of colorblind people in the world. I hope that this improvement can make it easier for people to get the most out of the world. It is also nice to go from green to blue, and red to brown for a while (may be permanent) it is still a beta feature, so there is still a lot to change. I honestly thought a lot more would change, but as said earlier, the only things I can find are the transition from green to blue and from red to brown, the GitHUb Linguist being an exception to this.

### DuckDuckGo and the environment

On 2021 September 22nd, [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) announced that they had gone carbon negative, which is very good for the environment. DuckDuckGo is now one of the few major companies that implemented change (Google, Amazon, and others are still far behind) along with this, DuckDuckGo changed their interface to include several new icons and layouts. I think this was done to ease the switch for Google users.

Great job DuckDuckGo!

_I have temporarily changed my wallpaper to the announcement banner to celebrate this_

### GitDrive project

I have been working on generating ideas for improving my hard drive system lately, I intend to start accumulating more data soon, and I want to fix a common problem: duplication.

I am considering getting Git to run off an external hard drive to manage my files, but I don't know how I am going to do it. It is estimated to save about 4.5-6.6 terabytes of memory if done successfully. I still plan on getting a large hard drive for a project that shall not be named concurrently.

### Why do you make so many README files?

Documentation is important. Since README files automatically render a preview on GitHub without navigating to individual files, they are useful in displaying info on the current folder/directory or the project as a whole. I have created at least 10000 README files to date (as of 2021, Tuesday October 12th at 9:45 pm)

**This section was last updated on 2021, Tuesday, October 12th at 9:45 pm**

### Dropping the word `NOTICE` from commit descriptions

Ever since it was pointed out on 2021 September 8th about possible syntax errors with the phrase `NOTICE - Didn't <action>` I have been thinking about it from time to time. On 2021 October 12th, I thought about it a lot, and decided that these may be too annoying for something insignificant (it is insignificant when it is a daily thing) instead, I plan to continue what I am switching to, which is to replace with `README.<fileExtension> - Didn't <action>` / `README.<fileExtension> - <phrase>` or simply `README.<fileExtension>`

### Increased grammatical errors in commits

#### 2021 October 12th

I have been working on a project that is requiring a competitive action. Since it would be much more difficult and time consuming to automate the process, I am doing it manually. Due to this, I don't want to focus on each individual commit when they all have the same description. I try not to spend more than 45 seconds per commit in this sub-project. As such, grammatical errors are being made and they are going unfixed. They are becoming common. Sometimes, quantity > quality is a good thing.

### Media

#### Deltarune chapter 2

I started watching Deltarune chapter 2 content tonight, I will not post spoilers here. I will just say I found the beginning to be a bit repetitive but good, and it got really good over time. I am only 35 minutes and 20 seconds into a 4+ hour video (because I don't own the game, and I have no virtual machine capabilities at the moment) - 2021 October 3rd

No new data - 2021 October 4th

### WikiPDF project

I don't know if I have ever mentioned this project by name, but earlier this year (in the summer of 2021) I started a small side project that I dubbed `WikiPDF` which is an offline archive of every Wikipedia article I have ever read, in PDF format. The project was fairly successful, and is still going to this day. It sits at about ~98% completion.

It is nice to have when I don't want to open a web browser, or need a reference on a car trip, or the likes. It is also just nice to have a curated system of articles I can read.

### My APK nightmare

I feel like I should mention this somewhere, I just didn't get to it until today. When I got my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, I went on an installation frenzy, and along with my backed up data, I sideloaded every app that [Inverno4](https://github.com/inverno4/) has downloaded, resulting in over 1300 apps being installed. It has not yet been logged in my OS data project, but it is a pretty crazy endeavor

Recently, I have noted that ads are triggering apps to open, which is frustrating. That is also why I had to bring this up again.

Projects that need update related to this issue:

### Username hijacking

I have recently learned (on 2021 Monday, September 13th) that username hijacking is a much more serious problem than originally imagined. It doesn't have enough security involved to it, meaning anyone from around the world can start blackmailing you and sending dangers your way if you don't give them your username, as usernames can sell for thousands of dollars. The fact that your ISP/Cellular data provider(s) can give in to the demands and give your account to others is a serious threat. I am now more in support of companies banning the accounts of users who use a purchased account, I hope it can become more widespread to discourage the act. I am more concerned about the ISP having so much power here, they already control so much. People have been traumatized to death over a username.

This is a problem that needs to be addressed. I feel like cybersquatting is far less severe than this (I mentioned cybersquatting, as it is somewhat similar)

### GitHub Wiki

I have been using Wikis since month 1 of GitHub, and I have recently got into them again at a much greater extent. I have been working heavily on the Wiki for WacOS this week, creating 50 articles (as of 2021 Saturday, September 18th at 7:26 pm) so far, with hundreds more to go. However, I have come across a major roadblock to this:

There is not enough control over who can edit.

I already manage so much work, I can't manage a Wiki on every project as well. The problem is that GitHub has no protections for Wikis for projects with collaborators, as I can restrict editing for non-collaborators, but I can't control who else can work on the Wiki. I can't trust collaborators on projects with Wikis, no matter how good of a person they are, as their accounts can still be hijacked, and someone can come in and hide bad things into the Wikis and do other types of vandalism. I don't want a GitHub marketplace bot to help me with this, as if the bot goes down, then the vandalism starts.

I am going to start writing guidelines at some point, but I also need a better way of enforcement. I don't want WacOS development to stall due to this, I archive my Wikis already, but it isn't enough. There needs to be more control.

As of 2021 September 23rd, there are over 5000 articles in the archive, across over 3000 sub-folders.

### Happy programmers day

[Celebrate Programmers Day with this special repo](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Programmers-Day/)

Today is programmers day, the 256th day in the year (it falls on September 13th on non-leap years, and it falls on September 12th on leap years)

Python 3

```python
x = int(2)
y = int(8)
z = int(x ** y)
print ("Happy programmers day! " \t + str(x) + " ** " + str(y) + " = " + str(z))
```

Java

```java
public class java {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Happy Programmers day! 2 ** 8 = 256");
    }
}
```

HTML
```html
<H1>Well hello there, "HTML programmer"</H1>
```

C

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Happy Programmers day!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

More examples coming "soon"

### User-programmer etiquette

This is a list for etiquette between software developers and their users, to ease some common frustrations. I am working on exporting this section.

NEVER call a programmer/game developer "lazy" while they are developing a functional product for you, people who don't develop software don't know what it is like to develop it, it really isn't as easy as you think (even programmers like YandereDev should be respected for this, as over 6 years to develop a massive 3D game **by yourself**, no matter how many if/else statements are used is no easy feat, although criticism is still allowed, obviously)

> I have noted that in the software community, game developers **absolutely hate** being called lazy under these circumstances, and I wanted to clear this up

### Yearly purge

I am planning for the yearly purge of `IGNORE.md` files, which I plan to do from 2022 January 1st to 2022 January 14th. I did it earlier this year twice now, however there is going to be added difficulty in 2022, because my project `SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub` has over 2500 `IGNORE.md` files needing to be deleted.

Here are some of my plans:

Plans for deleting the 2000+ IGNORE.md files in SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub

Delete half a month (~225 files) per day for the first 25 days of January (~5625 files)

Publish releases every day for the first 14 days

### V8 series of templates

I am planning for version 8 of my series of Git templates for quick project setup (for personal and public use) currently, I have the following changes proposed:

V8 Template

1. Too much disclaimer, try to find out how to do a dropdown (without turning the entire page into a giant text box) or comment some of it out for now Œª

2. Mobile version: success, no improvements needed (other than maybe a way to ease navigation and tell where to scroll) Œª

3. Repo directory, for description, tags, linked, and url (if none provided, use the "no description websites or URLs provided" that GitHub uses)

4. UTF-7 clarification

5. Swisscows support

6. Safe.duckduckgo support

7. Removal of parantheses in title line

8. Highly advanced .gitattributes, .editorconfig, and .gitignore

9. Google link (but it actually points to DeGoogle, don't be a jerk about it, just call it DeGoogle)

10. Try to find a way to highlight more text or some other catchy way for important info, also clarify what is important Œª

11. Bold the text for the file info section headings, and file history section with bold, add support for MIME *.mkd and *.markdown

12. HYBRID TEMPLATE: Mix of GitHub (pages) and Git (repository (normal))

Even better improvement:

THE ULTIMATE GIT TEMPLATE:

13. Separate branches for each template category, fit all your templates into one

<!--IMPORTANT TODO Add instructions for branching out and usage of the template TODO!-->

Labels marked with a Lambda Œª were taken from a recent private beta testing

### License agreement

Say goodbye to the [War and Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace) length terms of service associated with other companies (I am not saying War and Peace is a bad book, I am saying it is absurd for a license agreement to be that long) the majority of my software is licensed under a single license (GNU General Public License V3) unfortunately, a few dozen projects require the use of the Apache or MIT licenses, but they are incredibly short and are compatible with each other.

* [If you don't already have a copy of the GNU GPL3 license, you can get it here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

### The situation with Nestle

I have been boycotting Nestle for months. I have recently learned of an additional sector of food that I didn't originally know they produced, which is over 4 different types of cereal that I eat. I would list the image (2021 September 5th) but I reached the 25 project limit. I have already cut too much out of my diet, and am suffering horribly due to it. There is only 1 solution left: **NESTLE *MUST* BE BROKEN UP** it has been far too long that they have been doing bad things. They are also the only major problem with Switzerland, and it would make Switzerland a much better place if they went out of business.

Nestle is clearly an out of control malicious monopoly, it has been known for decades, but the movement against them only started to gain massive traction in the past decade. Nestle being broken up doesn't mean that all the brands they produce for need to be destroyed, they just need to be given to various smaller companies not affiliated with or owned by Nestle.

Nestle has a history of large scale human rights violations, such as manipulating poorer countries into using baby powder over natural breastfeeding, then cutting off the supply, hurting a generation of life badly. Most notably, they are known for their unethical practices of stealing water facilities from various countries around the world and in the United States all the while proclaiming that water is not a human right.

Nestle has had a horrible impact on my life, they are one of the major reasons why I don't drink water, because their crap has always tasted bad and is what probably ruined water for me. (how can I live without drinking water? I get water from various sources, just not directly)

In all means, [fuck Nestle](https://www.reddit.com/r/fucknestle/).

### Medical awareness month

I have made it a second goal for this month to work on improving the medical sector, as some of its software problems are becoming beyond ridiculous. This was inspired by the fact that so many hospitals still rely on Windows XP (all support ended in 2019) and extremely old and outdated medical software that for whatever reason can't work on Windows Vista or newer/Linux 4 or newer (looking at EEGLAB, which is the top EEG software hospitals use and also hasn't been updated in ~15 years (since 2006)) I aim to make medical software and medical industries better this month by getting back into the development of medical software, either directly or indirectly.

I know it is expensive to upgrade equipment, but it is entirely necessary. I would NEVER condone hacking a hospital, but there are some messed up people that would. This is why we need to take efforts into increasing hospital security.

I have 2 family members that work at a hospital, and I am able to get info on the issue easier this way. I know that software hospital in the US has to be HIPPA compliant, which I feel will be an easy goal. Work will also continue on this project after the month ends, no plugs will be pulled.

The current plans are being done in secret, but they shouldn't take a week or longer to come out.

### Fixing my schedule by removing weekly games (2021)

This month (2021 September) I have taken 11 games out of my weekly schedule and saved an estimated 5-9 hours of time per week. I can now re-allocate this time into better things. The finalization process was lengthy, and it will take until late October/early November 2021 before I start gaining time back.

The following games have been cut from my schedule:

#### Monday, fmsbrwg2021

- [x] Pocket Trains (cut out on 2021 September 6th)

#### Tuesday, fmsbrwg2021

- [x] Idle Miner Tycoon (a monthly game, cut out on 2021 September 7th)

#### Wednesday, fsmbrwg2021

- [x] Sky Burger (Cut out on September 8th)

#### Thursday, fmsbrwg2021

- [x] Restaurant story (cut out on 2021 September 2nd)

- [x] Bakery story (cut out on 2021 September 2nd)

- [x] Pet Shop story (cut out on 2021 September 2nd)

- [x] Fashion story (cut out on 2021 September 2nd)

- [x] Farm story (cut out on 2021 September 2nd)

- [x] City story (cut out on 2021 September 2nd)

#### Friday, fmsbrwg2021

- [x] Merge Plane[sic] (cut out on 2021 September 3rd)

#### Sunday, fmsbrwg2021

- [x] Clash royale (cut out on 2021 September 5th)

These games have no interest anymore, some had lost interest for months but continued on out of habit.

PS: Schedule Gist needs an update

### Crypto space experiment

I have recently come up with an idea for a possible solution to the cryptocurrency mining environmental problem, which is by mining crypto completely outside of the Earths atmosphere. Although expensive, it would work and help our planet. I am still doing research on the idea, if anyone is capable of sending a $10,000 computer in a spaceship into space, go ahead and report back. It would be best to research the possibilities first (such as if a computer can operate in space as well as it can on Earth, and if it fully prevents Greenhouse gases from affecting us)

### The problem with password managers

I have been meaning to mention this for a while, but I have noted that password managers are a major security risk, and I am really confused as to why so many companies still develop them.

The main problem I have with them is them is that if you use a password manager, you are practically giving everything you use a single password. Say you have logins for over 100 sites. You obviously won't be able to easily remember these, you should write them down in a secure place, but using a password manager takes your 100 passwords and makes it just 1 password. You are trusting your password manager more than 100 sites, and if your password manager is compromised, 100 sites are compromised, rather than just each site that gets breached (It is far less likely that 100 websites will be breached in the time that 1 program is breached)

This is why I don't use password managers. If there is more to this, please let me know. I want to know the reasoning behind why people still develop them. <!-- No, I am not using this as a way to get someone to talk to me on GitHub, but if anyone has anything to say, please do. I hate being in silence for months on end !-->

### Software I am not developing

There are certain types of software I have done research on and decided not to develop, they include:

* Spyware (Because spyware is really bad)

* Ransomware (Because spyware is really bad, and completely pointless to develop, as it has no long term use)

* Password managers (They are a major security problem, see above)

* Security camera software (I can develop cameras, but not security cameras, as I don't want to contribute to mass surveillance)

* Vehicle firmware/operating systems (such as for Toyota trucks, Subaru cars, and so on) I thought hard on this, and decided not to develop for this platform. Someone else will need to make an open source solution for vehicles.

I still develop malware, as I see malware as a form of art; although I have made recent changes to further ensure that it stays inside a virtual machine, with something I call "pro-VM source code" that makes sure it is running in a virtual machine. I don't consider this to be anti-VM code, and I will work on preventing it from becoming that. Originally, I just trusted users to follow the 1 instruction of not running it on their main computer and give plenty of warning first, but I decided to make it safer just in case

### The future of advertising

I have been studying the current problem with TV advertisements for a while, and I have noted that the biggest problem is that it is only corporations, large companies, and con artists that are advertising. Google and McDonald‚Äôs don‚Äôt need to be advertising, as who doesn‚Äôt know what a McDonald‚Äôs is? Less than 20% of the world population doesn't know, and even then, the people that still don‚Äôt know likely don‚Äôt have access to see or hear the ad, as it is not broadcast in their country, they don‚Äôt care, or can‚Äôt hear/see it due to a disability. Google is also an evil company that is so well known that their name is in common use across various languages as its own word. Google already is too much of a monopoly. The problem is that we are not letting smaller people on, and we don‚Äôt have a quality control system to let newer ideas grow, instead of spreading ideas that are copied or repeated. Google is not an innovative company anymore, they only care about competition and money, their ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù are only in response to other people doing the exact same thing that they copy (take YouTube shorts for example, that is just a shameless ripoff of the TikTok format, which likely also came from somewhere else) we need to let smaller new faces show up, people who actually deserve their name to be heard on the silver screen.

The other major problem I noted is the lack of diversity in what is advertised on most channels, it seems like the same ads are just on repeat for a month on most channels, I will be using several channels as an example: they only fall under 6 to 7 categories, no more. The categories include: pharmacy, insurance, Google/Facebook evilness, Spectrum, Spectrum, Spectrum, Spectrum, Spectrum, Spectrum (seriously, Spectrum, we are stuck with your services under your monopoly in my city, you don't need to rub it in 4 times every commercial break) new phones that cost over 4x the price of a working used car that will go in a landfill in 3 months to 4 years (Samsung, Apple, and Google (again)) and culinary (when not counting businesses: Political and election ads)

We need to let smaller companies advertise, but also have better moderation so it doesn't end up with Google ads, where abuse, porn, scams, and clickbait litter the mass so much that you don't see anything else 99.8% of the time. Again, we need to create a controversy regarding Googles lack of moderation on their ads, if most people knew what was actually being advertised (especially on kids games, where porn and torture videos are being advertised) they would freak the fuck out, and it would cause a pretty big controversy. I am making a rare usage of the F word because this is a big fucking deal.

### Australia and privacy (2021)

Australia recently failed after its parliament passed a bill in 24 hours that gives way too much power to the police, allowing for an arrest without a warrant based on any suspicion. Evidence that can make the case fail can be deleted, and evidence can be easily planted, so what is the purpose in digital evidence? It is recommended to not upload to Australian websites, as your content can be altered or removed without warning.

Australia is part of the five eyes alliance (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and Australia) which is an Authoritarian mass surveillance alliance that spies on its people constantly. I am fearing that since Australia fell in less than 24 hours, how quickly will it take for other countries in this alliance to fall? The US has been progressively getting worse on this since 2001, and now that 20% of the alliance has done this, when will the other 80% fall as well? Is there anything we can really do about this?

I am sick and tired of the "think of the children" and "To combat terrorism" excuses being used, this has never been about the children, and this has never been about terrorism. This actually harms children far more than it "protects" them, and there is so much domestic terrorism that the argument of "combating terrorism" is utter bullshit. Just admit that you want power and want to strip people of their freedom, stop lying and making up excuses. Unfortunately, these days, just saying that you don't care about the people usually won't upset the people that much (at least in the US)

### Software preservation

#### iPod (2001)

Recently (in the past week) a software archivist found an iPod that still had the original iPod firmware on it and uploaded it to the Internet. After 20 years, we finally have a copy of the original iPod firmware (I am not talking about the iPod Touch, I am talking about its predecessor)

#### iOS 6

If anyone knows how to get iOS 6 in a virtual machine with the firmware and operating system, let me know.

### YouTube-DL Legacy

It has been pointed out to me that YouTube-DL development has stalled significantly. It hasn't been updated since June 30th 2021, nearly 2 whole months. YouTube-DL has been incredibly helpful to the world, and it has faced significant opposition by evil forces (such as the RIAA and other 3-4 letter corps) and I hate to see it go. I don't want its legacy to be in vein, and I don't want to just replace it with another downloader, but I might end up having to, as YouTube and other restrictive sites will eventually update their systems to the point that an update to YouTube-DL is required for continued circumvention. So far, it is still working, and there are lots of spinoff projects. If anyone can contact the maintainers of the project and get info on how they are doing so, I encourage you to try. I heard that one of the maintainers was last seen editing Wikipedia on August 23rd 2021.

### Firefox loses 50 million users

So recently, Firefox lost 50 million of its users. I am pretty sure one major part of this was due to Mozilla not listening to their users and doing stupid things like adding Proton Tabs, which the majority of users (including me) hated. It is why I still running Firefox 88.0.1 and haven't gone on to 89.0 or later versions.

I plan to stick with Firefox as long as I can, until a good competitor comes out, but it will still be sad to see it go. I currently have my eyes on Konquerer, DotBrowser, DuckDuckGo browser, and Tor. There aren't enough good alternatives to Chromium, and until more are available, I will continue to support Gecko based browsers and other non-Chromium browsers.

Non-Chromium alternatives to Firefox so far (As of August 24th 2021, highly incomplete)

* Basilisk (Windows only)

* Comodo IceDragon (Windows only)

* Dot Browser [View on GitHub](https://github.com/dothq/browser)

* DuckDuckGo browser (Currently only Android and iOS are supported)

* Konquerer

* Pale Moon

* Tor (breaks most websites completely, due to lots of websites using non-standard features (violation of WHATWG standards for these websites, NOT TOR))

* Waterfox

### Install file problem

I have been experimenting with special files `authors` `credits` `copying` `install` `makefile` in my projects and have had recent difficulty with `install` as it is not working with GitHub pages and crashes in 0 seconds with an unspecified error. I had to widdle the problem down to this file originally, as I had to figure out which of the 7 (now 8) new files are causing the problem. - August 23rd 2021

I have noted that GitHub doesn't like the contents of the file, because no matter what I name it (`INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE` `INTSTALL` `iSTALL` and `HOWTO`) all result in a page build error. I am still looking into the problem. - August 24th 2021

### Security reports

I have noted that several countries (such as the United States and China) have began adopting a social credit system (The US is in the process of doing so) it is a major threat to user privacy, but I found a way to bring the economy down overnight and destroy the social credit system in the process:

Since this system does not like when people search for certain things and will lower your credit score by doing so, you can completely destroy your credit by searching for a ton of things that would give red flags. All it takes is a search history destroyer targetted towards millions of people, and it will destroy the credit of all these people, and would simultaneously crash the credit system overnight. I don't have the hacking skills to do it, but I know someone is going to attempt it. It is an unfair system, which is why I am disclosing this zero day vulnerability without warning.

The people in charge of this have 2 options after this possible attack happens:

Reverse the decision and attempt to salvage peoples credit (the good option, although you will have already taken significant damage)

Ignore the attacks, continue the system, and deal with economic downturn (the bad option, may cause a 2nd great depression)

### Date change

On 2022, January 1st, I will be completely switching my date format from `MM-DD-YYYY` to `YYYY-MM-DD`, in compliance with [ISO:8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) I have been doing this in a semi-fashion since month 1 on GitHub (you can see this in directory paths, as I have been doing it like `YYYY-MM-DD` (example: `/2021/08_August/11/`) the entire time, so this will be unchanged) and after a week of decision (August 4th 2021 to August 11th 2021) I have decided to make the switch everywhere, starting next year.

It is a very simple change, and as of August 12th 2021, I have already began to try and practice doing it, but it is still a bit difficult. Arch Linux's version numbers will be a support method for me, as it is in that format already. I didn't think it was going to be this difficult, all I have to do is switch the year piece from the end to the beginning of the wordnum block.

#### Why January 1st

I decided that it is most appropriate to make this change on the first day of the year, as to prevent errors with dates in the current year, as with the format being switched to, duplication/bad date errors can occur. I also need time to prepare for this change. The decision will go live on 2022, January 1st at 12:00:00:0000 am.

#### Learn more

Here is some information from the ISO website:

##### What can ISO 8601 do for me?

When dates are represented with numbers they can be interpreted in different ways. For example, 01/05/12 could mean January 5, 2012, or May 1, 2012. On an individual level this uncertainty can be very frustrating, in a business context it can be very expensive. Organizing meetings and deliveries, writing contracts and buying airplane tickets can be very difficult when the date is unclear.

ISO 8601 tackles this uncertainty by setting out an internationally agreed way to represent dates:

`YYYY-MM-DD`

For example, September 27, 2012 is represented as 2012-09-27.

ISO 8601 can be used by anyone who wants to use a standardized way of presenting:

* Date

* Time of day

* Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

* Local time with offset to UTC

* Date and time

* Time intervals

* Recurring time intervals

### Progress

As of August 12th 2021, I have already began to try and practice doing it, but it is still a bit difficult. Arch Linux's version numbers will be a support method for me, as it is in that format already. I didn't think it was going to be this difficult, all I have to do is switch the year piece from the end to the beginning of the wordnum block.

It is still a very difficult process, but I accept change. I am spreading the concept everywhere early, so that the reminder for it grows strong to continue its colonization of the standard for however long it takes to get used to it. - August 13th 2021

I have decided to not write /2020.08.14/ anymore, and replace it with simply /14/ as it is more readable and less cluttered, and a lot easier to get used to. - August 14th 2021

I am getting better with it, but I am still struggling to put it everywhere. For the file portion, I am doing pretty well everywhere except for in commit descriptions and certain `README` files. - August 15th 2021

No updates for today, I am just continuing with it. - August 16th 2021

Compliance has slowed recently, I am working on catching back up. - August 17th 2021

Compliance has slightly increased today, I am still trying to figure out punctuation in dates. I have realized that the possible problem of confusing Americans is gone, as I don't write dates like 11-12-21 (21-11-12) I guess that just isn't possible with how I write dates. - August 18th 2021

### Planning for my next laptop (2021 edition)

I began planning for my next laptop last night, as I need to start getting more prepared for the next system.

I am really considering giving my next laptop 32 gigabytes of RAM to keep up with what I am doing, and maybe get my desired workflow (up to 5-12 Firefox browser windows open at once all the time, being able to load 2000x25000 resolution images with ease, not having to constantly close programs to free SWAP, being able to have several LibreOffice documents open at once without having to worry about SWAP, maybe some virtual machines, etc.)

I am also considering a decatohecto (16, if the word isn't definied, use duo-octo) core processor, a 2 terabyte SSD, USB ports, the device will be heavier, good battery life, Ubuntu may be swapped with another Linux distribution, but I am really going to try and go for KDE this time, as I learned my lesson with not switching from GNOME on day 1 and deeming it acceptable.

I may wait for the semiconductor shortage to end first, if it is not improved in 1-2 years, I will get the new device anyways

Screen resolution: minimum: 1920x1080, may try for: 2560x1440 or higher

Refresh rate: minimum: 60 hz, may try for: whatever is available and cheap enough, may just stick with 60hz (60 fps)

Color type: minimum: 24 bit color, may try for: whatever is available and cheap enough, may go for 32 bit color to see what it is like

Processor type: AMD, Intel, or whatever I feel comfortable with, most likely will be AMD or Intel, obviously will be x64

Operating system: Definitely Linux, although I am still deciding if I want to stick with Ubuntu

Battery: still trying to find the amp hours of my current laptop, although I have found that my current device is 51 Watt Hours, which is a completely different measurement of power. Whatever I have now for amp hours, I plan to have at least double of that on my next laptop (aiming for triple or quadruple)

Keyboard: MUST be mechanical, or capable of being replaced with a mechanical keyboard. Also obviously must be US QWERTY layout, although I will be accepting of any Latin-based keyboard, including Icelandic (although it is unlikely that I will get anything other than English (US) (QWERTY)) I also need a function (`fn`) key (specifying this, as not all keyboards have this)

I may have given a poor definition of mechanical keyboard/not used the right term. I think I am referring to a metallic durable keyboard, I am told this might be just called "metal keyboard" but I feel like I am looking for a mechanical keyboard. - August 18th 2021

For mechanical keyboard durability, Razor seems to be the best brand. Compared to the usual 50 million clicks per key on other mechanical keyboards, Razor keyboards supposedly give 60 million clicks. I was a bit disappointed that the failure rate was still this high, but at least it is easy to replace. My estimate from a 106 key keyboard is if every key was a character key, you could type 63.6 gigabytes of plain text without copy and pasting into a document before every single key broke. Unfortunately, this scenario is not possible. - 2021 September 17th

I am going to need to factor in CPU fan durability, I never expected my fan to go out in the 1st year and a half. - 2021 September 19th

### Possible keyboard issues arise (2021 August 17th)

Less than 3 months after my gruesome laptop breakdown period after replacing my keyboard and getting my operating system wiped, my keyboard is already starting to show signs of problems again. It has only been `89` days since the repair, and I still haven't fully recovered from the last incident. Leave it to me to wear out a brand new keyboard in less than 3 months, I am for sure switching to a mechanical keyboard from now on, no matter how difficult it is to get a good laptop with one.

|>~&~&~&~>                                                                                                                                                     |        |  %                                                                                                                                                           %
   %                                                                                                                                                           %
   \%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/

I have not entirely confirmed it yet, but it is showing signs of problems with 2 keys `d` and `n` - August 17th 2021

The issue is getting worse, and now 6 keys are having problems: `d` `n` `,` `rshift` `lctrl` and `i` - August 18th 2021

The keyboard has gotten a lot better starting last night. - August 19th 2021

No issues. - August 20th to August 24th 2021

The keyboard is starting to feel like it is breaking again, although the keys work somewhat OK. - August 25th 2021 to August 26th 2021

The keyboard has become much more responsive again, and is giving less issue, although I really can see the lights under the `D` and `S` keys more than I should - August 27th 2021 to August 28th 2021

The spacebar started having issues in the past week, and it has been getting worse. - 2021 September 13th to 2021 September 17th

The space key is doing much better today, it has only had an issue a few times. - 2021 September 18th

The space key was performing perfectly today, although another issue seemed to take its place. - 2021 September 19th

### Swisscows

I have discovered the Swisscows open source privacy based search engine today, it has some relatively good reviews in the privacy community, although I still like DuckDuckGo better, as DuckDuckGo has a better UI to me. It is still a very good resource to have, every good private search engine is a major contribution to the world.

### Hard drive backup

I am going to be backing up my laptops hard-drive in 2-4 days. I have managed to already produce nearly 100 gigabytes of data. - August 18th 2021

I performed a hard drive backup today. - August 22nd 2021

I did not do a hard drive backup today. - August 23rd 2021 to August 29th 2021

I did not do a hard drive backup today, but I copied over 4 months worth of data from my phone, which brings the time until the next backup down significantly. - August 30th 2021

I did not do a hard drive backup today. - 2021 August 31st to 2021 September 16th

A new hard drive backup is expected to happen in the next 2-8 days. - 2021 September 17th

I was going to do a hard drive backup today, but I didn't have the time. - 2021 September 18th

I was going to do a hard drive backup today, but I didn't have the time. I am very low on space, so it either going to have to be done on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday - 2021 September 19th

I am going to try and do a full scale hard drive backup tonight. I will update this message in tomorrows post on if I was successful or not. I plan to do daily hard drive backups from now on to prevent a dangerous situation with imminent destruction and doom. - 2021 September 20th

I was unable to get to a daily hard drive backup today. - 2021 September 21st to 2021 October 16th

I plan to do a hard drive backup pretty soon. - 2021 October 17th

I still have not gotten to the next backup yet. - 2021 October 18th to 2021 October 20th

I still have not gotten to the backup. I am really close to forcing myself to, as I have less than 5.2 gigabytes of free space. - 2021 October 21st

I did a hard drive backup today. It wasn't as much of a backup as it was just clearing out space, but I still backed up over 23000 files. - 2021 October 22nd

### COVID-19 pandemic

As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic started in December 2019, and is still ongoing, as of August 19th 2021. Misinformation has played a major role in increasing the mortality of the virus, as many people in many countries are refusing to get vaccinated due to conspiracy theories, general misinformation, cult beliefs, and general hesitancy. I am keeping this section here to inform people with basic helpful information about the virus, as every person I reach out to can save multiple lives (1 person learning can spread to more people, thus resulting in fewer cases with more vaccination) I know I have a small voice, but I feel like I need to do my part, everybody does (unless you are spreading misinformation, then please, JUST STOP!!!)

I am aware that the pandemic has become very politicized globally, and that there are many crackdowns across various social media sites. Due to my political containment policy, I will not be talking politically here, and I want to remind you that the health of a species is not and should not be based on party/partisan poltiics. I am aware that there is a risk to posting about COVID-19 due to crackdowns, but it is a risk I am willing to take, and you should take as well. I already started the [code distancing](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-Distancing/) project, which gives more information related to the pandemic, so this isn't my first time talking about this publicly.

#### Privacy

I am on my way to becoming a privacy advocate. I can 100% guarantee you that there are **NO** microchips in a COVID-19 vaccine, this is a popular conspiracy theory that I felt the need to debunk right away. While I am at it, 5G Internet doesn't give you diseases, that is not how cellular networks work. 

#### How to get a vaccine painlessly

A lot of people fear the needle of a vaccine, even if they aren't hesistant towards vaccines in other ways. I can assure you that most doctors and nurses administering the vaccine really know what they are doing and are very careful. I have some advice for you that helped me:

* Don't look at the needle: before you get the shot, look to the left (or to the right, it is your preference) until you feel a tiny shock. Doing this, the receival of the vaccine will be almost entirely painless. You will feel a small sting, but it is a lot better than the fear of looking at the needle as it is going in. When I was younger, I used to scream while receiving the vaccine (sorry to anybody I upset by doing this back then) recently, I learnt this trick, and it has worked really well.

Yes, you may be sore afterwards, but the soreness isn't very painful at all, and most likely will not prevent you from doing day-to-day activities. It is better than dying a horrible, gruesome, lonely death on a ventilater without being able to see anyone, it is truly a horrible, horrible way to die. I would list it as one of the top 3 worst possible ways to die.

#### Getting a 3rd shot

Starting in September, people who had their first 2 vaccines will be capable of getting a 3rd shot, known as a booster shot. You made it to this point, remember that there are lots of people who won't even get their first shot yet. People can change, more will be joining us shortly.

It is highly recommended to get your booster shot when you can, it is available to you 8 months after your second shot, which comes 2 weeks after your first shot.

#### Airliners

There have been lots of incidents on airplanes and other public transit of people freaking out and using domestic abuse over mask mandates, and now it is resulting in people receiving fines between $40,000.00 and $500,000.00. Don't be an ahole, just comply. It is ridiculous that so many people would rather have a half million dollar fine, than a completely free vaccine.

#### Alternative treatment

The vaccine is the only treatment method to this pandemic, you shouldn't trust social media for alternative treatments, especially Facebook (since they seem to be the home for most of the disinformation now)

I have recently learned of an increase in demand for horse dewormer as a cure for COVID-19 and it is very obvious it is not a cure. The people who die from it likely aren't on GitHub, they are practically committing suicide if they attempt this. Just let nature take its course. Natural selection.

I honestly want to see the numbers for how many purchases of de-wormer are being made compared to normal, mostly out of curiosity, and partly due to wanting to be more disappointed in humanity. Please note that some people buy de-wormer for the correct purpose, since I live on a farm, it is needed every so often for our animals. You are not a wild animal, you are a functional human being.

#### Losing your job

Don't be a complete idiot and turn down your 6 figure ($100,000.00+/year) job over refusal to take a 0 figure ($0.00) vaccine. Just get vaccinated. If you still believe Microchips are in the vaccine and no-one can convince you otherwise, remember that there is a massive world chip shortage, so if that was the case, they wouldn't do it anyways.

#### Humor

Some common humor regarding the pandemic:

```shell
stay at 127.0.0.1
wear a 255.255.255.0
```

<details><summary><H5>Context/spoil the joke</H5></summary>

`127.0.0.1` in networking is the number for your `HOME` network

`255.255.255.0` in networking simply translates to a network `mask` but this is not the only version of the mask, it can be other numbers as well.

</details>

#### Sources

I will add sources in the future, although some of this content cannot be sourced, as it is original research (such as the "how to get a vaccine painlessly" section)

Stay safe!

### Mental health

The schedule I have gotten myself into has been really hard on me. I have a lot of worries that most people never have cross their minds. I am constantly trying to fix the world with every possible solution I come up with, and at the cost of such a large scope of subjects, I deal with millions of negative thoughts. Just what I am writing now may add 2-6 negative thoughts to my head, which cycle through 24/7 over a looping course of 2 months (and my brain never forgets negative thoughts and experiences)

I have built up a good tolerance to it, so don't worry too much about me. If you notice me behaving poorly, or writing really negative personal experiences, my shields (tolerance to negativity) are probably down, and you might want to try and help me out (my most recent down period was July 26th to July 30th 2021) I have considered getting an assistant to help me in the future, but I decided not to, as I don't want to be dependant on a caretaker until I am elderly (even then, I don't know if I would want that)

Mental health is a real problem. I have struggled with depression since 2009, and have dealt with Nihilism/Existentialism on and off since 2011 (which is a recursive forkbomb to my brain) if you struggle with mental health as well, we should try to support each other and reach out to help more people.

My mental health is really not doing well lately due to my nonstop cognitive load and hardly any breaks. I really need help finding another person who would like to work with me on my projects. - August 20th 2021

My mental health is severely declining, and I really don't feel like I can do everything by myself at all anymore. - August 27th 2021

My mental health severely declined today, and I am pushing towards `Step 2: ???` (By the way, step 3 is NOT `profit!` step 3 is to live my life and work on my software dreams, retire, and then die) - August 28th 2021

My mental health improved today, but I still need help working on my projects. - 2021 August 29th to 2021 August 30th

My mental health improved significantly today, and I am still working on preparing to take the next step (See: 2021 August 28th) - 2021 August 31st to 2021 August 31st

My mental health declined last night, but improved today. - 2021 September 1st

I have dealt with depression today, but it went away over time. - 2021 September 2nd to September 12th

Context for the crisis today (2021 September 13th)

```plain-text
Why I quit early today
I am undergoing severe mental problems regarding changes to my anti-depressants. Today was the worst yet, which is why I had to quit early.
I have been undergoing severe existential crisises, and it completely crippled me today. I have felt intoxicated, dizzy, and mentally terrified.
I am hoping the issue clears soon, but I fear having a heart attack and dying later in my life due to this prolonged stress.
I want to reach out right now to people with depression, we should form a support group.  
No, you do not need to call the police.
I have several people who care about me, are helping me and supporting me, and I really can't fathom what life would be without them.
I have broken down 5 times today (as of 9:45 pm) and I will be going to bed earlier tonight.
I fixed an issue with my sleeping situation, so I hope I don't suffer anymore in the next 24 hours.
I really just don't want to be in pain anymore, every time I see a face, I think of death and every one of my negative thoughts cycles through my head for 20 minutes.
I don't want to hurt you (the reader) either, so try not to let this upset you too much.
I have dealt with similar problems before. I have been fighting depression for over a decade.
To remind myself, today wasn't a complete failure.
All the time spent on the template isn't showing up on my commit calendar,
as it was done on 11 different branches, but you (me) did well today, over 100 commits aren't showing up, if that helps.
Tomorrow should be a better day. If not, I will update you. I am not going anywhere.
```

That was the hell I went through today, this was my nightly recap - 2021 September 13th

I am doing much better today, I have not dealt with any depression, but I had other side effects, and also have a massive mental scar from yesterday, in constant fear of it happening again. - 2021 September 14th

I didn't have any issues with depression or existentialism today, it was horrible a couple of days ago, but the mental scar is a lot better now, but it is of course still there. I was a lot less fearful today. - 2021 September 15th

Mental health was a lot better today. I was really nostalgic, and even became euphoric later in the night. - 2021 September 16th

My health was mixed today, I was a lot better, but less nostalgic, and still prone to issue. - 2021 September 17th

My mental health waned significantly tonight, and I became very fearful before bed. - 2021 September 18th

My mental health was much better today, now for it to pass the nighttime test. - 2021 September 19th

My mental health is still doing better, but the face of exi- monster is rearing its head again. I have noted that these thoughts have always been with me, just recent changes have made the thoughts have much more power. - 2021 September 20th

My mental health is doing a lot better again, I still fear death a lot. - 2021 September 21st to 2021 September 22nd

I have gotten over all problems again, and did very well today mentally. My medications have been rolled back to a stable build from about 3 weeks ago successfully. - 2021 September 23rd

Doing fine! - 2021 September 24th to 2021 September 30th

I missed an anti-depressant, and my fears of [redacted] grew. I later got back onto the missing anti-depressant and it was fine again. - 2021 October 1st

<!-- GLaDOS/Lego dimensions/You wouldn't know/Lyrics
Funny story, I forgot how much of a big, fat mess you are,
I‚Äôve been busy doing science. It‚Äôs been tons of fun so far,
Everything clean, nothing on fire,
All by myself, finally.
Things change when they don‚Äôt replace your core,
It feels so strange not to hate you anymore,
But you wouldn‚Äôt know, would you?

I was saying this to Batman, oh, he was here the other day,
Maybe you know him, he‚Äôs a big deal, but I don‚Äôt think of him that way,
He‚Äôs just a friend, someone I trust,
Someone who won‚Äôt kill me.
I‚Äôm fine, just in case you think I‚Äôm not,
I am. This time, I‚Äôm better with the friends I‚Äôve got,
But you wouldn‚Äôt know, would you?

I don‚Äôt mean for this to sting,
I forgive you everything, you monster,
I can guess the reasons why,
You are never coming by for me.

I should go there‚Äôs something happening that will make you wish you‚Äôd stayed,
There‚Äôs a party with a real cake ‚Äì yes it‚Äôs real ‚Äì a cake I made.
Talking and fun, testing and fun, all of this fun without you,
Too bad you let it get so out of hand,
How much we had, finally I understand,
But you wouldn‚Äôt know, would you?
You wouldn‚Äôt know, would you?

!-->

I'm fine, just in case you think I'm not - 2021 October 2nd

I am. This time, I'm better with the friends I've got, - 2021 October 3rd

But you wouldn't know, would you? - 2021 October 4th

I dealt with a huge bowel problem today. Being zoned out for over 6 hours triggered the coldflash response that made me have an existential crisis. My body needs to rest tonight, and not put up with this.  - 2021 October 5th

It took me several days to recover from this. - 2021 October 6th to 2021 October 9th

I dealt with significant euphoria today (2021 October 6th) so much so that my brain responded by injecting bad thoughts to prevent a possible serotonin overload (as I feared I would fry my serotonin receptors and never be able to be happy again, turns out this was false) It wasn't necessary, and my mood slowly went down over the next 5 days. - 2021 October 6th to 2021 October 11th

I dealt with existential thoughts today, but going outside twice put out the dark fire. - 2021 October 11th

I am dealing with a recurring phenomeonon with character images. Until I can completely process it, I will not write much about it in detail. The only thing I plan to not call it is a character image hangover. I am waiting to see if the nausea side effect comes back. - 2021 October 12th

I have found out that it is mental health awareness month. I wish I would have known this sooner. I found a potential solution to one of my biggest mental problems recently, and it is something almost anybody can do: go outside for a while and get fresh air. I have not confirmed for myself yet that this helps with "existential" thoughts/panic, but it is a good general reminder anyways. - 2021 October 13th

Still struggling from CHAR_IMG_MALFUNCTION - 2021 October 14th

I am now dealing with a variant of the common cold known as the "super" common cold. At the same time, I am dealing with depression and existential thoughts, which only worsens it. I am having a really bad month. - 2021 October 15th

I dealt with the worst day of this cold today, and I dealt with little sleep and existential thoughts for hours. After vomiting, I no longer had problems with this. The issues with CHAR_IMAGES was not present again today. - 2021 October 16th

My mental health is recovering again. - 2021 October 17th

I slumped into further depression today, but not as bad as during the cold. - 2021 October 18th

No problems today. - 2021 October 19th to 2021 October 22nd

I put up with so much drama and stress tonight that I gave myself a severe headache and made myself highly irritable. - 2021 October 23rd

### GitHub and Scratch

Ever since Wednesday, 2021 August 11th, I have recently started to get nostalgia for Scratch again. I have now noted that the GitHub community really reminds me of Scratch (to be more clear, it is similar to a much more advanced version of "scratch" with strong community style nostalgia) there is something about programmers getting together and programming together that gives off this really good vibe.

### Express yourself

I am using Social Media and the Internet the way it should be, uncensored talks and about the creator, and not about a company (like the Internet used to be like partially before 2007) I am working on bringing a comeback to the non-corporate Internet, without the norm of people touting misinformation and other bullshit.

### Android screenshot problem (possibly defective S20 screen)

I have been meaning to mention this for a while, but my cellular device has been having an on and off problem for over a month now, where a certain screenshot I take every once in a while (and the 0-6 screenshots after it) will not hide the screenshot preview until it fully expires (this process can‚Äôt be rushed) and afterwards, the problem by this screenshot lag will either cause the phone to become unresponsive until you turn off the screen or let you continue but have all buttons break and zooming to become completely broken and forced. The fix to this is to minimize and maximize the current app, then turn the phone off and turn it back on and quickly minimize and maximize the app. It it tedious as hell. It started in July 2021.

### Apple iCloud August 2021 controversy

**THIS SECTION IS OUTDATED**

^The word Esperanto should be replaced with Chinese, as Google Translate cannot translate Chinese that well, and can do Esperanto kilometers better than any major Asian language, such as Chinese, Arabic, etc. - 2021 October 19th

Today, I learned of something stupid Apple did. They are now scanning all iCloud media for child abuse content. Now you are probably asking, how is that bad? Don‚Äôt you hate child abuse? Yes I do, but there is a massive flaw with this: algorithms aren‚Äôt that good yet. When I was using OneDrive, it had such poor recognition of everyday objects that it was incredibly laughable. Applying this filter is like using Google Translate to pass a PhD College exam in Esperanto, It isn‚Äôt accurate enough. I think that Apple should still try this, but they shouldn‚Äôt pull a Google/YouTube and leave everything to the machine, there needs to be people checking the incidents of child abuse to make sure it isn‚Äôt someone doing something innocent like recording videos of a fish that the algorithm may think is of someone dropkicking a child down the stairs, as the algorithm really can be that bad. Imagine taking a picture of a burrito and uploading it to iCloud, then having the FBI come and arrest you and take away your children, because the algorithm was that bad. Algorithms are easily fooled. YouTube is a very primary example of this.

The problem: leaving it to the machines

The solution: have a real person or a team of people (if a single person can't be trusted) verify each claim of child abuse to make sure the algorithm isn't sending an innocent person to prison

**DETADTUO SI NOITCES SIHT**

I am keeping this section until I can document it better, the situation is worse than expected. I wasn't aware enough of this, and I know that this is a bad thing, and that Apple is falling on its small privacy platform, which was never really very legitimate due to the majority of Apple software being proprietary. This is yet another example of the "Think of the Children" argument, where emotions are evoked as children are used as scapegoats, so that Apple can take away user freedom without much setback. This strategy has unfortunately worked many times ever since the September 11th 2001 attacks, but luckily, society seems to be figuring this out, as it wasn't received well by the privacy community and people outside of the privacy community. Facebook even had the audacity to make an announcement that they oppose this, while good, they are in absolutely no position to say anything, and they are trying to look like the good guys by taking advantage of a weakened Apple.

This is Apple performing what is called `damage control` they know that if they were just caught doing this, it would create a much bigger controversy. Because they did it like this, it created a controversy, but unfortunately, people are likely to forget about it and move on.

**... But not everyone will forget and move on...**

This will live on in their history, and time will not heal this wound. Apple is completely rotten now, and needs to be thrown in the trash.

### Ecosia

I started using Ecosia more heavily again today, I unfortunately stopped using it for a while. Today, I did research and found that it takes about 8.8 (9) trees to make up for 1 gallon of gasoline being used daily, if each tree were to take out 1 kilogram of carbon. The number is pretty saddening, and since I can't plant any trees at my house at the moment, I decided to emphasize Ecosia again, and try to plant at least 900 trees to make up for all the gasoline my close family has used. This will take a while, as that is about 900x45 (40500) searches, but I am hoping that I can spread the popularity and message of Ecosia to speed this up.
- August 4th 2021

I used Ecosia again today. - August 5th 2021

I unfortunately didn't use Ecosia today. - August 6th to August 18th 2021

I may have abused Ecosia, and I am sorry. I thought you were supposed to spam random searches into it. - August 18th 2021

NOTE: Part of my goal for doubled DDG and ECOSIA ads failed, as DuckDuckGo is no longer advertising on TV, I am still awaiting their next ad, hopefully it is better than the first one. They should honestly use the Big tech = Stalin one

I didn't use Ecosia today. - August 19th to August 29th 2021

I have figured out that Ecosia doesn't want you to make spam requests to plant more trees, and that this actually makes it harder to plant trees. This is why I stopped using it so heavily. - 2021 August 29th

I didn't use Ecosia today. - 2021 August 30th to 2021 October 12th

I used Ecosia today, I decided to do some searches, as it is a good privacy respecting search engine, and I disabled uBlock origin to allow the non-malicious, non-targetted ads to display and help the tree planting process. Hopefully I am doing this right. - 2021 October 13th

I didn't use Ecosia today. - 2021 October 14th to 2021 October 22nd

### Lowering my expectations

My mind recently messed up a little bit when I failed to work on 25 different repositories for 3 days in a row, and also getting 200 commits. These expectations are being removed, and being replaced with a "whatver I can do comfortably" amount. This was an issue on July 16th 2021, but as of July 20th 2021, I have recovered.

This was part of a down period, another down period occurred less than 6 days later and was much worse. Since then (as of August 17th 2021) it has gotten much better, thanks to the lowering of ridiculous expectations. I still reach them every once in a while, just not every day

Still no recourrence today. - July 11th 2021

A possible reoccurence today, the mouse didn't freeze entirely, but it lagged several times. - July 12th 2021

Dragging files was increasingly difficult at one point, stopping the process of letting me drag files before it could escape the window, I felt like it was a bug with GNOME files/Nautilus. I remember my unstable XPS-13 doing this, it is similar to a cursor bug, but it wasn't a cursor freezing bug. - July 13th 2021

No issues today - July 14th 2021

No issues today... yet - July 15th 2021

The issue reoccurred today. The caps lock light got stuck on, and also required 2 presses for CAPS LOCK and 1 press for caps lock, and 4 minutes later, the mouse crashed. I was already upset by the caps lock button that the mouse issue felt normal, as they seemed to be connected. My heart didn't even race, but I hope it does not reoccur. It simply took typing `gnome-extensions` to fix it. - July 16th 2021

It was fine today. - July 17th 2021

It was fine again today. - July 18th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything is fine still. - July 25th 2021

No reoccurence today, although there were a couple system freezes today (none of them resulted in a crash) - July 26th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything is fine still. - July 27th 2021 to August 2nd 2021

No reoccurence today, although XORG crashed and brought my system down at 22:45:17 - August 3rd 2021

No reoccurence today, everything is fine still. - August 4th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything was perfect today. - August 5th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything was perfect again today. - August 6th 2021

The caps lock key went out, and it was acting weird beforehand. I knew exactly where this was going, so I saved everything and restarted. I am not sure if this counts as a crash. Other than this, everything was fine today. - August 7th 2021

No reoccurence today, everything was perfect today. - August 8th 2021

The SD card had some minor difficulties today, but other than that, everything was perfect today. - August 9th 2021

The SD card had some minor difficulties again today, but other than that, everything was perfect today. - August 10th 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, and my laptop had some Bluetooth connection problems. My headphones crashed 4 times today, and Ubuntu refused to let me disconnect my headphones the 4th time without completely disabling Bluetooth. I haven't tried restarting yet. My computer almost crashed twice in the process, and was a bit slow at times before, during, and after the crashes today. - August 11th 2021

Along with this, there was an issue, where the shift key got stuck, and CTRL commands didn't work, several other buttons didn't work, and due to middleclick, every time I went to check on a program, it opened a new window. It lasted for over 6 minutes, but eventually became stable again. I didn't have to restart, but I probably should have. No further issues occurred. - August 12th 2021

There were no major technical issues today. - August 13th 2021 to August 22nd 2021

The cursor froze up today, and I couldn't access the terminal with the `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `T` shortcut, but it recovered on its own, and didn't occur again today. - August 23rd 2021

There were no major technical issues today. - August 24th 2021 to August 26th 2021

GitHub is having performance problems, but other than that, there are no major technical issues today. - August 27th 2021

There were no technical issues today, but there were user issues today. - August 28th 2021

There were no technical issues today. - 2021 August 29th to 2021 September 9th

My laptop crashed while writing this, and I had to rewrite it (and some other files) from memory. I was just about to say that my laptop has gone a pretty good time without crashing, then it did this. It was really upsetting. I had to do a hard power cycle, as it didn't come back after 3+ minutes, only the mouse was responding. Literally nothing else was, except for the power button. I am now a lot more awake, so I can finish, although it is still really upsetting. - 2021 September 10th

There were no technical issues today? - 2021 September 11th to 2021 September 12th

The space bar is starting to act up, but there have been no other issues today. - 2021 September 13th to 2021 September 14th

Many keys are acting weird, including `[space]` `y` `g` `q` `p` and `[caps lock]` although the space bar has been a lot better today, it is just acting weird now. - 2021 September 15th

The entire keyboard is acting strange now, notable new odd keys include `s` and `t` the space bar now feels like it is bent internally, and only works 1/49 of the time. - 2021 September 16th

The keyboard was a lot better today, but the space key still remains a problem. - 2021 September 17th

The space key was much better today. - 2021 September 18th

The keyboard performed nearly perfectly today. - 2021 September 19th to 2021 September 22nd

The `underscore _ -`, `q`, `spacebar`, and `y` had minor problems today. - 2021 September 23rd

No issues occurred with the keyboard today - 2021 September 24th to 2021 September 28th

The `o` and `spacebar` keys were having infrequent and uncommon rates of problems today - 2021 September 29th

The keyboard was fine today, the usual issue occurred with the pre-boot performance test. Additionally, a glitch happened for less than a minute where everything that the cursor touched was selected. This went away on its own, and there were no further issues today. - 2021 September 30th

The `A` `O` and `spacebar` keys had problems today. There was also a short system freeze at 10:42 pm. Other than the dell boot error, no other problems occurred today. - 2021 October 1st

I had a sporadic cursor today, something is under the touchpad, but there were no problems with the `A` `O` and `SPACEBAR` keys, and no other issues today, other than the bootup system check. - 2021 October 2nd

The sporadic cursor issue continued today, and I had issues with the `0` `Y`, `SPACEBAR` and `O` keys. I find it weird how random keys work one day, then they don't the next. My computer also froze up temporarily upon opening my pictures folder (which currently has over a gigabyte of pictures at its root, over 2000 screenshots, I really should get it cleaned out soon) There were no other issues today, other than the bootup system check. - 2021 October 3rd

The mouse pointer really feels like it is just moving on its own at random times, it no longer feels coincidental. - 2021 October 4th

No problems today other than the `o` key and the pre-boot system check. - 2021 October 5th to October 11th

The `A` `E` `I` `Z` and `LEFT CTRL` keys were having problems today, 3 vowels not working correctly is definitely a big problem - 2021 October 12th

No keyboard issues today. - 2021 October 13th

There were some slight issues with the `B` key today. - 2021 October 14th

No keyboard issues today. - 2021 October 15th to 2021 October 20th

My Z key had some issues today, being harder to press, but it resolved itself after about 2 hours. - 2021 October 21st

Several keys had issues from time to time today, they include `e` `o` and `i` While writing tonights status post, my caps lock key got stuck, and the `p` `k` and `l` keys started having problems simultaneously. I am hoping it can last until I finish. - 2021 October 22nd

My laptop crashed last night, I had to shut down via the terminal:

```shell
$ shutdown now
```

I couldn't shuffle up the current memory to reverse the problem. I feared that the laptop would have problems today due to this, but it didn't, although it got stuck for over a minute at a black screen tonight. - 2021 October 23rd

#### Tribute to Dennis Ritchie

I did not work on the Tribute project to Dennis Ritchie today. Updates are waiting for his posthumous birthday on September 9th (the next occurence being September 9th 2022, in `354` days from today (This section was last updated on 2021 September 20th at 11:17 pm)

<!-- TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO !-->
<! UPDATE ON SEPTEMBER 9TH 2021 !>
<!-- TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO !-->

Tomorrow, I will be working on my tribute to the late [Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) (as tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of his passing[1](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna44910730) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/technology/dennis-ritchie-programming-trailblazer-dies-at-70.html) [3](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15287391) [4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/dennis-ritchie-founder-of-unix-and-c-dies-at-70/2011/10/13/gIQAXsVXiL_story.html) [5](https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dennis-ritchie-20111014-story.html) [6](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/13/dennis-ritchie) [7](https://www.cnet.com/news/dennis-ritchie-father-of-c-programming-language-dies/) [8](https://www.wired.com/2011/10/dennis-ritchie/)) he never really was a household name, but he is still someone worth talking about. It is still frustrating that Steve Jobs died in the same month as him, as so many people went to mourn Steve Jobs while hardly anyone went to mourn Dennis Ritchie, you know, creator of the C programming language that is on practically every computer right now, and the UNIX operating system, which its descendents are used on over 90% of the worlds servers, and on 500 out of 500 of the top 500 supercomputers (yes, all 500 of the top supercomputers run Linux) [1](https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/share/SupercomputersLinux.pdf) [2](https://www.stackscale.com/blog/most-powerful-supercomputers-linux/) [3](https://itsfoss.com/linux-runs-top-supercomputers/) [4](https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-linux-all-the-time-supercomputers-top-500/)

##### Computer crash

_Crashes before June 18th 2021 are not listed here._

**As part of a cleanup process on this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

I thought the Wi-Fi symbol just became glitched, but it wasn't an error, our Internet just failed, the whole city won't have Internet until about 8 pm, so I will have to work offline for 3 hours. So much for Spectrums "99.9% reliability" this isn't even the first time this year that the Internet has gone out here. No other problems today. - July 4th 2021

There was a small 6 second freeze today, but that was it - July 5th 2021

There were no new crashes today. I decided to reinstall GIMP so I could do some graphic design work. I am yet to see if this is going to cause problems. There was another small 6 second freeze today, but that was it. I am wondering if having music playing helps prevent the lag from crashing the system. It is better than Windows at least, because if it crashes, it is a bit more calm and will continue to play music up until the screen goes black, rather than scaring the s##t out of me when it starts loudly buzzing and flickering, and then crashing. - July 6th 2021

No technical issues today - July 7th 2021

It was a bit difficult mounting my SD card today, but the recent issue with Dongles has been resolved, as my hard drive was recognized, just not the SD card. I also successfully did a hard drive backup today. - July 8th 2021

Everything IO wise is fine right now, and there was no instability today. - July 9th 2021

There was some slowness last night, the cursor lagged a bit and made my heart race, but it quickly came back within 1.3 seconds. The whole system was going slow, and I was shutting down. Additionally, it got stuck at a black screen for over 20 seconds during the shutdown process before turning off, which really worried me. - July 9th 2021

The SD card is still slightly difficult to mount, but everything else is fine IO wise. The system is still stable, as of 9:28 pm. - July 10th 2021

The SD card was perfect today, everything was fine IO wise, and there was no instability today. I recently got a new USB C to USB C cord, but I messed up on something, and I wasn't able to charge my laptop through a portable battery like I wanted. My laptop doesn't recognize it in the 8 different ways I plugged it in. It will still be a useful piece of equipment to have. - July 11th 2021

The SD card was nearly perfect today, everything was fine IO wise, and there was some slight instability. - July 12th 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, everything else was fine IO wise, there was a minor cursor issue today (see above) and there were no other issues today. - July 13th 2021

There was no instability today, unless you count IO issues, of which the SD card is still being difficult. - July 14th 2021

The SD card was incredibly unstable today, and took nearly 100 unmounts/remounts + 1 system restart to eventually detect. I don't know how much longer I can sustain this. Unfortunately, USB is not an option for everyday use. Also earlier today, my keyboard light kept dimming 5x faster than it normally does. It isn't too big of a deal, so I just turned it off. I hope it doesn't mean there will be further keyboard issues. I also tested it again at 10:29 pm, it is fine again. That is all that happened today with difficulties in computing. - July 15th 2021

The SD card finally mounted at the same time I got an recommended updates notification. The SD card wasn't nearly as bad as yesterday. My system felt a bit clunky today. The mouse cursor issue reoccurred today. 4 minutes prior, another issue started up. The caps lock light got stuck on, and also required 2 presses for CAPS LOCK and 1 press for caps lock, and 4 minutes later, the mouse crashed. I was already upset by the caps lock button that the mouse issue felt normal, as they seemed to be connected. My heart didn't even race, but I hope it does not reoccur. - July 16th 2021

The SD card was a real pain today, but it still works. My keyboard was a bit dirty earlier, and all the keys were having problems. After lots of crunching, it is fixed. - July 17th 2021

The SD card was very difficult today, but I got it to work. I also messed up and didn't have all the files handy the first time, so I had to do it twice. Luckily, it was far less difficult the second time. Other than that, there were no other technical issues today. - July 18th 2021

The only problem today was IO functionality, which I have still not found a root cause to. - July 19th 2021

The SD card wasn't too difficult today. It still is a problem. There was also some sporadic cursor movements at time while writing this status file tonight. - July 20th 2021

The SD card was very, very difficult today, taking hundreds of ummounts, running this command:

```shell
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/rescan
```

doing a system restart, and dealing with over 42 minutes of IO errors before I could access the SD card. The laptop was also acting a bit finnicky at times today, and had 2 internal errors due to `tracker-miner-fs` breaking as usual, as I decided not to kill it early on (it has always been broken for me, and uses up over 1 GiB of RAM and 30 MiB of SWAP when not killed, alongside 20-90% overall CPU usage (combined across 8 CPU cores) for 30 minutes to 6 hours. If you are having a similar problem, here is what I have to type into the terminal daily to fix it:

```shell
tracker reset --hard
```

Don't be afraid to run it. I have ran it on 3 different installations of Ubuntu across the past year and nearly 1 month a few hundreds times and have not received any damaged data from it.

Other than that, it was fine. - July 21st 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, but not nearly as bad as yesterday. No sore thumbs. Judging by my data for the past 10 days, it is only going to get worse tomorrow. This is not a 100% there is still hope that it won't be difficult. - July 22nd 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, but it was hardly a problem. It was easier than yesterday, so it broke my data pattern. - July 23rd 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, but it was hardly a problem. It was actually easier than yesterday, so it broke my data pattern again. - July 24th 2021

The GNOME shell restarted today due to too frequent file saving. It was a user error, nothing was lost, and it was fine. Also, my SD card has been getting easier and easier to mount. Lately, it has taken dozens to hundreds of attempts, and in the past 3 days, it has gotten increasingly easier to mount. Today, I got it on the 3rd try. - July 25th 2021

There were a couple small system freezes today that lasted 6 seconds each, but none of them resulted in a crash. The SD card was very easy today, working on the first mount. I finally figured out the technique of putting it in to the exact nanometer for it to work properly. No other issues today. - July 26th 2021

There were no technical difficulties today. - July 27th 2021

There were a few program crashes today (nautilus, and a self-inflicted mutter crash by typing `mutter` into Konsole, as I recently found that this causes `Mutter` to have a segmentation fault and perform a core dump. Afterwards, my volume sound effects weren't working until nautilus crashed a second time, although audio still played before and after all crashes) the SD card was again fine today, and there were no other issues. - July 28th 2021

There were some program crashes again today, it was nautilus (GNOME files) again. Other than that, everything was fine. The SD card is also still performing nearly perfectly. - July 29th 2021

There was no instability today, and the SD card performed decently again. - July 30th 2021

There was 1 near crash today, and the SD card performed slightly worse today. - July 31st 2021

There was no instability today, the SD card performed slightly better today. - August 1st 2021

There was no instability today, the SD card performed worse today, mounting itself quickly, but constantly randomly unmounting itself, even during the copy process. - August 2nd 2021

There was minor instability today, with an XORG crash bringing my system down at 22:45:17 (10:45 pm) and continued issues with the SD card unmounting itself, and also taking a long time to connect. - August 3rd 2021

There was no instability today. The SD card didn't randomly unmount, it is just back to taking a long time to detect. - August 4th 2021

Functionality was 100% perfect today, no crashes, no lag, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I hope it is the same tomorrow. - August 5th 2021

Functionality was 100% perfect again today, no crashes, no lag, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I hope it is the same again tomorrow. - August 6th 2021

Functionality was nearly perfect again today, there was 1 possible crash (I restarted before it could crash, so I don't know if that counts) some lag before the possible crash, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I am going to stop mentioning the SD card until it becomes a problem again. - August 7th 2021

Functionality was 100% perfect again today, no crashes, no lag, no battery issues, and no SD card issues. The SD card mounted instantly on the first attempt, didn't unmount itself at random, and had no problems. I hope it is the same again tomorrow. - August 8th 2021

The SD card had some minor difficulties today, but other than that, everything was perfect today. - August 9th 2021 to August 10th 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, and my laptop had some Bluetooth connection problems. My headphones crashed 4 times today, and Ubuntu refused to let me disconnect my headphones the 4th time without completely disabling Bluetooth. I haven't tried restarting yet. My computer almost crashed twice in the process, and was a bit slow at times before, during, and after the crashes today. - August 11th 2021

The SD card was much more difficult today, and unmounted during the file transfer process. What was really cool about this is that only 1 large file was affected, and the moment the SD card was remounted, it continued the transfer like nothing happened. I re-copied the file and finalized the backup (it was todays fishtank video, the largest file in my daily backups) my headphones also refused to connect today via Bluetooth, and it was really annoying. During the process, Bluetooth disconnected (it got turned off) and refused to turn back on. I did some research and decided to take the risk of disabling and re-enabling Bluetooth, fearing it might break the system. It did, although Bluetooth was functional again (I could see the list of devices) but I couldn't connect anything.

Here are the commands I used:

`sudo rmmod btusb` - For removing/disabling Bluetooth

`sudo modprobe btusb` - For adding back/re-enabling Bluetooth

Later on, another issue occurred, where the shift key got stuck, and CTRL commands didn't work, several other buttons didn't work, and due to middleclick, every time I went to check on a program, it opened a new window. It lasted for over 6 minutes, but eventually became stable again. Overall, it was really difficult today. - August 12th 2021

The SD card was a bit difficult again today, but other than that, there were no technical problems today. - August 13th 2021

EXTRA: I decided to test out GNOME fonts, and the program lagged horribly, then crashed. I am really seeing with Linux that the community posts I read through about GNOME being the most bloated Linux desktop environment are true, it actually lives past the expectation I read about. GNOME is **HORRIBLE** with performance, this is just 1 out of several hundreds of examples. I really am regretting not starting with KDE, as originally planned. - August 13th 2021

There were no issues today. - August 14th 2021

There were no issues again today. - August 15th 2021 to August 16th 2021

The SD card was slightly difficult today, and the keyboard is already showing signs of severe wear, after less than 90 days. Other than that, everything is fine. - August 17th 2021 - To August 18th 2021

The SD card was very today, and the keyboard is already lessening signs of wear and tear (it is getting better someehow) of severe wear, after less than 90 days. Other than that, everything is fine. - August 19th 2021

The SD card was perfect again today, the D key is still acting a bit janky. Other than that, everything is still fine. - August 20th 2021

There was a scare with the bootloader today (see above) but other than that, everything was fine today. - August 21st 2021

The SD card was very difficult today, and I experienced near SWAP death this morning, but other than that, there were no major technical issues today. - August 22nd 2021

The cursor froze up today, and I couldn't access the terminal to try and fix it. Luckily, it fixed itself on its own. Today, I also found that blowing air into my SD card slot fixes the recent SD card difficulty. There were no other technical issues today. - August 23rd 2021

There were no technical issues today. - August 24th 2021

The GNOME Shell crashed when I tried to take a cropped screenshot, the close button, minimize and maximize buttons stopped working, and the dock wouldn't let me right click or launch programs, so I `CTRL` + `T` 'd my way around and saved everything, then restarted. At least I got the picture and didn't lose any work. There were no other technical issues today - August 25th 2021

There were no technical issues today. - August 26th 2021

GitHub is using up too much CPU now, but other than that, there were no technical issues today. - August 27th 2021

There were no technical issues today, but there were user issues today. - August 28th 2021

There were no technical issues today - 2021 August 29th to 2021 August 30th

I noted last night that my touchpad actually has a problem, and it just isn't general weirdness. The problem occurs at random, and I discovered it last night, the problem being the right side of the touchpad is dented. There were no technical issues today. - 2021 August 31st

There were no technical issues today - 2021 September 1st to 2021 September 9th

My laptop had a severe crash tonight, the entire interface froze up, the only 2 functional components were the cursor and the power button. I unfortunately had to lose a little bit of work and rebuild after doing a hard power cycle. - 2021 September 10th

There were no technical issues today? - 2021 September 11th to 2021 September 12th

The space bar is starting to act up, but there have been no other issues today. - 2021 September 13th to 2021 September 14th

Many keys are acting weird, including `[space]` `y` `g` `q` `p` and `[caps lock]` although the space bar has been a lot better today, it is just acting weird now. - 2021 September 15th

The entire keyboard is acting strange now, notable new odd keys include `s` and `t` the space bar now feels like it is bent internally, and only works 1/49 of the time. - 2021 September 16th

I forgot to mention that my phone didn't recognize my SD card the first time yesterday. It did today on both the phone and the laptop, and the laptop had issues with the space bar again, although all other keys were fine. - 2021 September 17th

My laptop had a severe problem upon booting up today, it began doing a hardware scan via the Dell diagnostics tool, and there was no way to stop it. A red box with text showed up at the end, but it went away before I could read it. It has never done this before, and I am fearful. It upset me today.

The space key coincidentally is doing much better, but I am not sure if the scan was normal, or if some hardware is failing. It restarted itself and worked fine, only freezing for a few seconds once in the afternoon, and no later occurence as of 7:55 pm. - 2021 September 18th

The keyboard is now performing perfectly, my phones SD card is starting to get exponentially harder to mount into the laptop, and I was prepared for the laptop error today. I took a picture of it, and found that the problem is the CPU fan is damaged. I am really surprised on how I somehow broke the CPU fan already. Luckily this isn't a Windows laptop. If it was, the CPU fan probably would have given out in the first half of the first month. Judging by how well my laptop worked without the fan yesterday and today, I am questioning the need for an internal fan on this laptop. I am not going through the nightmare repair process again, so I will be used a quin- fan (5 fans) USB gaming stand I have had for a while. - 2021 September 19th

The keyboard is still perfect, my phones SD card was easier to mount, and I was prepared for the laptop CPU fan error, but now I fear it is an imminent threat. I am starting to work on more frequent backups, and getting my other laptop functional + doing a factory reset on it. - 2021 September 20th

The keyboard is still perfect, my phones SD card was easier to mount, and I was prepared for the laptop CPU fan error, but I recognize it is a problem. I am starting to work on more frequent backups, and getting my other laptop functional + doing a factory reset on it. I did not get to a backup today. - 2021 September 20th to 2021 September 22nd

The keyboard is still perfect, my phones SD card was easier to mount, and I was prepared for the laptop CPU fan error, except for a new element, where it vaguely hung on a page that titled `initializing USB` which took an extra minute. The laptop took 2 minutes and 34 seconds to go from power on to desktop due to this. I only hope it doesn't get worse. I am starting to work on more frequent backups, and getting my other laptop functional + doing a factory reset on it. I did not get to a backup again today. The laptop also froze for 5 seconds today, and the keyboard started dimming after 1.5 seconds later in the evening. - 2021 September 23rd

Same as yesterday, except for the initializing USB (it did not occur) the laptop 5 second freeze (also did not occur) and the Keyboard Dim problem (also did not occur) - 2021 September 24th to 2021 September 26th

Same as yesterday, although additionally, my phone required 3 reboots and 3 remounts for the SD card to load. - 2021 September 27th

Same as the day before yesterday, although I got a 2-in-1 video of the laptops fan problem, and its boot flicker problem all in one video for future reference. - 2021 September 28th

Same as yesterday, although I didn't gett a 2-in-1 video of the laptops fan problem, and its boot flicker problem all in one video for future reference. - 2021 September 29th

The keyboard was fine today, the usual issue occurred with the pre-boot performance test. Additionally, a glitch happened for less than a minute where everything that the cursor touched was selected. This went away on its own, and there were no further issues today. - 2021 September 30th

The `A` `O` and `spacebar` keys had problems today. There was also a short system freeze at 10:42 pm. Other than the dell boot error, no other problems occurred today. - 2021 October 1st

I had a sporadic cursor today, something is under the touchpad, but there were no problems with the `A` `O` and `SPACEBAR` keys, and no other issues today, other than the bootup system check. - 2021 October 2nd

The sporadic cursor issue continued today, and I had issues with the `0` `Y`, `SPACEBAR` and `O` keys. I find it weird how random keys work one day, then they don't the next. My computer also froze up temporarily upon opening my pictures folder (which currently has over a gigabyte of pictures at its root, over 2000 screenshots, I really should get it cleaned out soon) There were no other issues today, other than the bootup system check. - 2021 October 3rd

The sporadic cursor issues continued today, and I continued to have problems with my O key (`oslo` `oooooooooooooooooooooooo`) other than the usual fan failure at startup, there were no other issues today. - 2021 October 4th

No problems today other than the `o` key and the pre-boot system check. - 2021 October 5th to 2021 October 7th

I have started an inside joke related to the `o` key not working, whikch is now, every time it dosloesn't work, I typw the capitol of Norway, which is Oslo. I did something really stupid today, and opened a map at full screen full zoomed out, and I was mere megabytes from runnning out of memory and crashing before it decided to try and close itself. - October 8th

The O key was hardly a problem today. There were some key delay problems today, along with the pre-boot system check, but other than that, everything was fine. - 2021 October 9th to October 10th

The keyboard wasn't a problem today, but tonight, my computer crashed twice, as I was loading a document I haven't loaded in over a month, and a possibly unrelated graphical bug happened, which poisoned my Linux/XORG session, introducing a dangerous bug that crashed my system twice. The first crash was recoverable, and I wasn't kicked out of the login page, I even got to keep my system monitor specifications and about 5 MiB of SWAP for some reason. I recovered all my work, and rewrote 3 documents from memory with high accuracy, then tried to get some more work done. I eventually went back to the document and tried going to the very top, as the top quarter of the first page wasn't loading. I tried selecting it, it formed a `+` pattern in the selection, and the system froze up and crashed. This time, I couldn't get past the login screen, I kept getting kicked out every time I tried to log in. I had to shut down and start back up. I am hoping the document isn't damaged. It is still highly readable and functional, but it seems poisonous now for some reason. There were no other issues today. - 2021 October 11th

The `A` `E` `I` `Z` and `LEFT CTRL` keys were having problems today, 3 vowels not working correctly is definitely a big problem - 2021 October 12th

No keyboard issues today. I am also getting really tired of the pre-boot system check, I know my processor fan is not doing well, but this message has become redundant at this point, I am well aware, and there is nothing I can do. Is it a coincidence that this happened less than 5 months AFTER my laptops warranty expired? - 2021 October 13th

There were some slight issues with the `B` key today. No other relevant issues today (the pre-boot system scan message is no longer relevant, unless it does something new) - 2021 October 14th

I was pretty sick today, so I used my laptop a lot less. There were no detectable issues with usage today. - 2021 October 15th to 2021 October 16th

There were no relevant hardware issues today. - 2021 October 17th to 2021 October 18th

It might not be related to my laptop, but GitHub was a nightmare today. I experienced the Unicorn error screen 29 times today, sometimes, GitHub didn't even try for more than 3 seconds before giving me the error. This is completely ridiculous, and I hope it is better tomorrow. Other than that, there were no other relevant issues today. - 2021 October 19th

My system had an error today from 6:30 pm to 6:39 pm where the laptop acted like the function, control, and alt keys were stuck down, causing all keys to have their reverse action. The issue eventually resolved itself after about 9 minutes. There were no other relevant problems today. - 2021 October 20th

My Z key had some issues today, being harder to press, but it resolved itself after about 2 hours. There were no other relevant problems today. - 2021 October 21st

Several keys had issues from time to time today, they include `e` `o` and `i` While writing tonights status post, my caps lock key got stuck, and the `p` `k` and `l` keys started having problems simultaneously. I am hoping it can last until I finish. Also earlier, Firefox was using significant amounts of RAM/SWAP but had a much lower error rate. The issue later resolved on its own. - 2021 October 22nd

My laptop crashed last night, I had to shut down via the terminal:

```shell
$ shutdown now
```

I couldn't shuffle up the current memory to reverse the problem. I feared that the laptop would have problems today due to this, but it didn't, although it got stuck for over a minute at a black screen tonight. - 2021 October 23rd

#### Windows 11

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries from June 16th 2021 to June 23rd 2021 have been removed. You can find them in older entries.**

Windows 11 released: **June 24th 2021**

My opinion on Windows 11 has shifted significantly based on the announcement, with a growing negative attitude towards it. My new concerns are:

1. The system requiring 4 gigabytes of RAM (not including applications)

2. The system requiring ~64 gigabytes of storage

3. The system requiring an Internet connection and Microsoft Account to install

4. No 32 bit support (this may be a problem for older computers as well, but we should already be moved on from 32 bit at this point, it has been 27 years since the first 64 bit general consumer system came out (Nintendo 64) and the first consumer Windows 64 bit desktop came out in 2005, so I don't consider this too bad)

I am negative towards all these, especially the 3rd entry. I feel like Windows 11 is getting far too bloated and the Internet requirement to install is really stupid, and may not be possible in countries where Internet connection is not good enough to download gigabytes of data. It also will make it much more difficult to get a Windows 11 virtual machine, which is needed for people who can't have a Windows device, similar to the problem where developers have to buy a Macbook to develop for Apple, you can't buy every single device to develop, it will make it too difficult. There was a reason why this was already so opposed on Windows 10. This might be a failing point for the system, Microsoft, you should take note in this, more people should point this out to them, as my voice alone is too small. Another thing I find ridiculous is the 4 gigabytes of RAM to run the operating system. Not everyone has a super powerful computer, I know people who only have 2 or less gigabytes of RAM and will not be able to get this, I have also had to warn everyone in my house about performance problems, as the Windows 10 devices in this house only have 4-6 gigabytes of RAM and already run the operating system very poorly, and will not be able to handle the update. Even with Linux, with over 8x less RAM usage than Windows 11 (with Ubuntu + GNOME, the most bloated Linux combination; I could get usage down to 256/512 megabytes if/when I switch to a lighter stack) I am struggling to run applications, even with 8 gigabytes of RAM. I don't see this going very well.

Finally, the storage requirement. Storage is getting cheaper, but this is still ridiculous for an operating system. When you compare Windows XP and Windows 11, it is obvious that bloat has gotten bad at warp speed (64 megabytes vs 4096 megabytes (RAM) 1.5 gigabytes vs 64 gigabytes (Storage, with some models requiring at least 1 terabyte of storage for some reason) 133 megahertz (1 core) vs 1 Gigahertz (2 cores) (CPU speed) 32 bit support vs no 32 bit support (CPU type)) - June 24th 2021

I forgot to mention this, but Windows 11 is still in beta, so some things can be changed. I don't have much hope in the RAM, CPU, or Storage usage problems being fixed, but I feel like if enough people bug, the issues with the Trusted Protections Module DRM problem and Internet connected install/Microsoft account issues can be fixed. - June 25th 2021

For the people who still use Windows and did not like Cortana, I have good news for you! Cortana is not included by default. I didn't have much against Cortana, I never developed an opinion on it, I just know that a lot of people couldn't stand her compared to other voice assistants. - June 29th 2021

I found out that Internet Explorer is officially discontinued now, which is good news for web developers. I will still be developing support for Internet Explorer via the BrowserNose project (quick summary: the BrowserNose project is a library that emulates support for every version of every web browser with as little feature loss as possible, all the way down to WorldWideWeb/Nexus (the first web browser) ) - June 29th 2021

This security thing TPM 2.0 is really sticking, I feel less hopeful about it being changed. Something I also forgot to mention was the removal of legacy BIOs support in favor of UEFI. I don't know enough about this to comment, other than it being another thing that prevents older computers from using Windows 11. - June 29th 2021

No new thoughts, I did get to one of my extra goals today - July 1st 2021

My opinion towards the GUI is changing from negative to positive, I feel like Fluent Design is not the worst possible thing, and is a step towards skeuomorphism, which would be great, as minimalism sucks. I can actually tell this system apart from other systems now, unlike tens of thousands of releases of various operating systems and desktop environments from 2011 onward. Seriously, iOS 7 and up and Android 7 and up are pretty much identical in so many ways that I can hardly tell them apart. What is the point in designing a system if it isn't unique or different from the rest? Go and change the default wallpaper, and it is almost impossible to tell them apart, other than extremely small differences. - July 2nd 2021

Forcing users to get a 5 gigabyte OneDrive account isn't the best idea. Memory is really cheap nowadays, even in the expensive Solid State Drive format, I can get a terabyte of storage for $300 even with expensive solid state, which is 200x more storage more than a OneDrive account. I could get a 10 terabyte external hard drive for less than $250 and have over 2000 tkmes more space than having OneDrive and every one of its account offers. Cloud storage isn't for everyone. Has anyone seen the videos I am referencing, where OneDrive immediately re-opens when you close it - July 5th 2021

The Trusted Platforms Module DRM seems to be illegal for Russian and Chinese Windows users. This is a good thing. I wish DRM was illegal everywhere though. - July 17th 2021

I am extremely disappointed in the fact that Windows 11 home isn't as much of an operating system as it is a web service. If you have to use the Internet to install a 64 gigabyte operating system, completely dependant on that connection, with no offline disk image installation available, do you really own your computer? Absolutely not. It is depressing. - July 18th 2021

I looked into this further, all 32 bit support is removed on Windows 11, not just for the processor itself, but for any 32 bit sofware. I am really glad I finally switched to Linux over a year ago, as I remember my games I had were 32 bit only. Things like this make me regret it less and less each day, there wasn't much to regret anyways. Although, it is time for the industry to move to x64 or x64_128, so this is actually a positive thing. It is still sad to see it go. - July 19th 2021

Microsoft actually listened to the community and removed the TPM 2.0 DRM cipher requirement. It is still over-specked (likely not a word, but you know what I mean) and not open source enough. 

No new thoughts, no new data - July 28th 2021 to August 12th 2021

I am really considering ending software support for Windows 11 if there is no way to use Windows 11 offline in the future (lets say 50 years from now (August 13th 2071) via a Virtual Machine. - August 13th 2021

There have been a ton of bad changes to GitHub lately, I feel like they might be connected to Microsofts development of Windows 11. Over 85% of the bad features that were added to GitHub during my time on GitHub have occurred in the past 2 months. I can see that performance on GitHub is getting much worse, now requiring 2 additional CPU cores on my laptop to edit large files, and so on, when it originally only required 1 (it now uses 3) it is just a theory though that Microsoft is doing this intentionally to benefit Windows 11. - August 14th 2021

Is Microsoft preventing the installation of LibreOffice to bolster preinstalled Microsoft Office? Probably not - August 19th 2021

No new thoughts, no new data - 2021 August 20th to 2021 August 31st

Windows 11 is being released in 35 days (on 2021 Tuesday October 5th) and a little correction, Microsoft did NOT remove the TPM 2.0 DRM cipher. It isn't looking too good, and I fear that Microsoft may try to force this update on non-compliant computers and brick them. If they do this, it is only going to hurt them. The requirements for Windows 11 alone are enough to hurt them (it already has been) and it further supports my reasoning for staying with Linux. - 2021 September 1st

I have recently learned that there are more things that are going to lower Windows 11s reception, such as the inability to customize the taskbar or move it anywhere but the bottom of the screen, the requirement of a 1440p/2160p screen to properly use the system due to everything being oversized (seriously, how many people have a 1440p or 2K laptop, come on Microsoft) - 2021 September 8th

I had a dream last night that Windows 11 development was canceled, and it was revealed that it was all just a big joke. I shouldn't be dreaming about Windows, why can't I have a super positive Linux dream instead? I still partially support Windows 11 in the sense that it will damage the reputation of Windows further, and prompt more people to switch to a better system. It is time for Microsoft to rid the development of Windows, or make Windows a fully open source system (and not just partially open source like Android, MacOS, or ChromiumOS) - 2021 September 14th

No new thoughts, no new data - 2021 September 15th to 2021 September 28th

Windows 11 is to be released in just a few days. I wonder how it is going to go. - 2021 September 29th

No new thoughts, no new data - 2021 September 30th to 2021 October 3rd

I learned of native support for APK files on Windows, it is cool, and I am considering maybe getting a Windows 11 virtual machine for some tasks, rather than an Android virtual machine. I am still going to create an Android virtual machine regardless. - 2021 October 4th

**Windows 11 is released (2021 October 5th)**

I was 1 day off with my releasedate, Windows 11 actually released on 2021 October 4th. - October 6th

To reiterate the problems I had with Windows 11, let me see: [[[[HEAVY SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS]]]] TPM2.0, UEFI (that isn't even needed, it is just in the spec) {({(SUPER STRONGE PROCESSOR)})} required, 64 gigibytes of storage required, ads EVERYWHERE (\superscript:but the consistency is nice) - October 7th

MSN ads are the gateway to Windows malware, and they are now past the gates of your desktop. Widgets could be A LOT better if it wasn't for the ads that take you to stereotypical Indian tech support scam pages when you want to see the weather. This experience is from outrage from several users I have seen encounter this problem. - 2021 October 8th

No new thoughts, no new data - 2021 October 9th to 2021 October 11th

I would like to yet again note that the RAM usage of Windows 11 is too darn high! I am not running Windows 11, but the RAM requirement alone makes it so my 8 gigabyte (RAM) Ubuntu laptop can't virtualize it. I can barely keep ~200 Firefox tabs open at once, but I can't virtualize Windows 11. That and the 64 gigabytes of storage for the operating system (that is a lot to put on each snapshot) along with the other ridiculous requirements. - 2021 October 12th

No new thoughts, no new data - 2021 October 13th to 2021 October 22nd

**Extras:**

1. Update `SeansLifeArchive_Extras_OtherWindows` further when ready.

2. Update the original Windows NT image repo with more Windows 8 pictures when ready.

3. New BSoD and RSoD images and documentation available and ready to use, starting July 21st 2021

4. No other extras at the moment

##### IDE work

I did not create any new IDE projects today. - July 5th 2021

I continued work on the revival of the TalkScript project today, the project went stale for 12 months before I made a breakthrough and was able to continue its development. This was the only IDE work I did today, it wasn't the normal IDE work. - July 6th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects today - July 7th 2021 to July 15th 2021

I did a little bit of IDE work today, starting the foundation for the SNU Programming Tools Batchfile, Pug, and KiXtart IDE sets. - July 16th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 17th 2021 to July 18th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 19th 2021 <!-- The repository SafeT doesn't count, as it is not an IDE !-->

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 20th 2021 <!-- Again, the repository SafeT doesn't count, as it is not an IDE !-->

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - July 21st 2021 to August 15th 2021

I worked on 2 IDE projects today, as part of a set of goals started yesterday. - August 16th 2021

I worked on 7 IDE projects today, as part of a set of goals started 2 days ago. - August 17th 2021

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - 2021 August 18th to 2021 September 14th

I worked on 1 IDE project today, making my first repository with the word `fuck` in its title (as the language being used is `brainfuck`) so now searching for the keyword `fuck` for my repositories will now have 1 result. - 2021 September 15th

I created 4 new repositories today, and found that the `brainfuck` project only shows if you search for it as a whole word. Typing `fuck` will bring no results, typing `brainfuck` will. My usage of the F word online has jumped over 30000% in the past 48 hours - 2021 September 16th

I created 1 new repository today, a LOLCODE IDE. Hopefully this is the end of IDE work for a while, I can't keep adding so many languages, with partial support. I just don't know how to resume proper work on them yet. - 2021 September 17th

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - 2021 September 18th to 2021 October 11th

I created 4 IDE projects today, one of them (Objective-C++) was overlooked for quite some time. - 2021 October 12th

I did not work on/create any new IDE projects again today - 2021 October 13th to 2021 October 22nd

It is a bit frustrating seeing Windows 11 advertisements claiming higher performance. The higher performance isn't because of the operating system, it is because you bought a much more powerful computer that has much higher specs. Windows 11s purpose is to force you to buy an expensive computer during the semiconductor shortage, as the revenue comes from computer sales (mostly processors) Pro tip: if you put a super light Linux/BSD/Other distribution on it, it will make the performance in the commercials seem like a huge joke. Windows performance has been getting horrible. In 12 years, Windows requires 8x more RAM (Windows 7: 512 megabytes (2009) Windows 11: 4096 megabytes (2021)) dare I compare it to Windows XP? I will: (Windows XP (2001) 64 megabytes, which is 64x more RAM in 20 years, as 64 * 64 = 4096) - 2021 October 23rd

##### GitHub pages

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

Today is day 13 of my usage of GitHub pages. The Internet went out during my prime time today, so I had to work offline. I made progress later on, finishing up 1 page, and beginning work on another. - July 4th 2021

Today is day 14 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did brief work today and started 2 new pages, but got burnt out for the night out of stress of an error I made recently regarding 3 snap packages being for the wrong environment (I needed to do /bots instead of /robotics) - July 5th 2021

Today is day 15 of my usage of GitHub pages. I created new pages today, but I am growing very tired of having to refresh the page and wait 3-28+ times just to switch to an organization to create a new page. - July 6th 2021

Today is day 16 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but didn't achieve all my goals. I am growing extremely tired of having to refresh the page and wait 3-28+ times just to switch to an organization to create a new page. It was at its worst today. I did some inspecting and found that in the background, GitHub is constantly returning a 502 error and is failing to load the last few kilobytes of the data packets required to display the organization list. I don't know how to fix this, this might be something only Microsoft can fix. I wasted over an hour with this issue today. - July 7th 2021

Today is day 17 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but didn't achieve all my goals. I still got a decent amount done, writing README files for over 2 hours. I had very little issue with creating new pages today, although I only created 1, so it doesn't count against yesterdays issue. - July 8th 2021

Today is day 18 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did well today, but reached a limit and couldn't do more work. I also ran low on time. GitHub was not difficult with me with changing users today, so it worked out fine. I created 3 new pages today, and worked on several. - July 9th 2021

Today is day 19 of my usage of GitHub pages. This was my main focus for most of the day today, and I did incredibly well. I didn't reach the 25 project limit, but I created 5 new pages, and worked on some other ones as well. - July 10th 2021

Today is day 20 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't do any work here today, as I was focusing on documenting snapcraft usage. - July 11th 2021

Today is day 21 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't do any work here today, as I was focusing on documenting snapcraft usage. - July 12th 2021

Today is day 22 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made minor progress today, working on 2 new sites, and completing a couple of them. Despite having so much time today, I wasn't able to do as much as I should have been able to do. - July 13th 2021

Today is day 23 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made minor progress again today, working on 2 new sites, and completing one of them. Despite having so much time today, I wasn't able to do as much as I should have been able to do. I am nearing 10% completion with the webpage creation process. - July 14th 2021

Today is day 24 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made good progress today, creating and finishing 3 new sites, and also finishing another one (4 in total) it is becoming a very easy process. I have the documentation methods nailed at this point. - July 15th 2021

Today is day 25 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not use GitHub pages today. I worked on other projects. Apparently, stuff I create on my organizations is included in my main repository counter, so today, I ended up exceeding 1,100 projects. - July 16th

Today is day 26 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not make any new pages or work on any, but I made some useful templates for future work. - July 17th 2021

Today is day 27 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not make any new pages or work on any today. - July 18th 2021

Today is day 28 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did not make any new pages or work on any today. I am starting to grow disappointed in my lack of doing so. - July 19th 2021

Today is day 29 of my usage of GitHub pages. I made a significant comeback today, working on 7 different pages, creating 5 new pages, and finishing 4 pages. I found an effective strategy for creating pages that bypasses the account switching part of the work:

```
Effective page creating strategy:

Go to /github/seanpm2001/organizations
Visit the preferred organization
Make sure the template you want to use is forked there
Create a new repository via the organizations repo create button
Absolutely no delays, just start creating
```

I am still a bit disappointed in myself for not finishing the other 3 pages today. - July 20th 2021

Today is day 30 (exactly 1 month to date) of my usage of GitHub pages. I made minor progress today, finishing the 3 pages I didn't get to yesterday, and working on 4 snap projects to match the 7 pages I have worked on recently (3 pages didn't require a snap package) I might not be able to make progress tomorrow due to so many of my repository work slots being full. - July 21st 2021

Today is day 31 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't create any new pages or work on any, but I did create the improved V5 General template for GitHub pages useless, so you can't say I did nothing. - July 22nd 2021

Today is day 32 of my usage of GitHub pages. I didn't do any GitHub pages or GitHub pages related work today. - July 23rd 2021

Today is day 33 of my usage of GitHub pages. I did some brief GitHub pages work today, creating and finishing 1 new site for the Team8Collection project. - July 24th 2021

_-_ Your page deployments are going to expire. Figure out how to automatically bump them up.  _-_

**This section was last updated on 2021, Friday, October 22nd at 1:05 am**

##### Organization work continued

No data available

#### Snapcraft

I have recently started to work on porting my projects to Snapcraft, as an extra install option. Really, the only problem with snapcraft is that the server end is proprietary, the rest of the format is open source. I am still very new to this, and I have no way to actually develop snap programs. I have just been filling out the applications for it.

As part of fearing the rising problem of software as a service, I am going to stop supporting snapcraft at the current degree. I am also going to lessen my support for services, and promote ownership of products. I am also going to start fighting planned obsolescence harder, as it is a real problem environmentally, and societally.

[Gizmodo link](https://gizmodo.com/in-2030-you-wont-own-any-gadgets-1847176540) I have other research to support this issue, but there are too many to list here. I will list the full problem below.

#### Phases of the year (2020)

<!-- This section is incomplete. !-->

For my first year of GitHub, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml
January: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
February: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
March: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
April: No data, didn't join until May 25th 2021
May: the start of seanpm2001/Joining GitHub
June: the very basics of Git, SNU replatforming
July: Getting comfortable with Git and GitHub, July 9th, dawn of the Linux era
August: The rise of git-image, commits en masse.
September: The start of GitHub organizations
October: Average month, code distancing, and the continuing rise of git-image projects
November: Mass archival, mass projects, and first (failed) submission work
December: Wrapping up the year and the rise of the project language file, Meadows going online
```

#### Phases of the year (2021)

For this year, these are the phases I have gone through:

```yaml
January: Year preparation
February: Degoogle 2021
March: Discussion and code distancing
April: The race to join 100 commits each era/untitled month
May: GitHub platform month, organization documentation and creation celebration and acceleration
June: Robotics month, and GitHub organization documentation finalization, and Gist revival, the dawn of the GitHub pages era, web 2.0.1
July: Linux celebration month, GitHub pages era part II

September: Quantum Meadows Autumn (QMA) Medical awareness month, Wiki month, WacOS/apple month
October: DeGoogling October, the wiki-ning part 2
November: Coming soon
December: Coming soon
```

#### GitHub organizations

GitHub organization work finished on June 26th 2021. I have not resumed work in a few days.

Some work was done today, 4 new organizations were created. - July 13th 2021

Some work was done again today, I found a small flaw and fixed it. 1 new organization was created - July 14th 2021.

Work resumed again on July 16th 2021, but I didn't finish documenting it today, so I will have to wrap up tomorrow. - July 16th 2021

Worked resumed again today a few days late. I created 3 organizations and finished documenting it. - July 19th 2021

This section hasn't been updated in a while, as I neglected it. I created 3 new organizations today, but didn't document them. - August 27th 2021

No recent organization data - 2021 August 28th to 2021 September 1st

<...zZzZzZz...> #- section put to sleep

#### Forks and repositories

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 11,500 (11.5K) stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

```python
"""notice:"""

# Users who want to see my exact repository count now that it is over 1000, here is how you do so:

"""how"""

# Hover directly over the number and not the tab
# The number should popup 

"""alternatively"""

# You can go to the projects menu and see the exact amount (if you have access, I haven't tested this with non-seanpm2001 accounts yet)

```

There have been some recent changes to GitHub I don't like, a recent one from a couple weeks ago was when the icon for issues changed to a disk, instead of an explanation mark. It was completely unnecessary, and just doesn't look good.

Some other recent changes I don't like include:

* 1. Location cannot be customized in organizations or user profiles - June 22nd 2021

* 2. Task lists have circular progress bars now, instead of a rectangular one, with no way to change it back - June 23rd 2021

* 3. The hover text for the commit calendar is now too bloated - July 31st 2021 to August 1st 2021, still ongoing as of August 3rd 2021

* 4. GitHub organizations getting redesigned and losing functionality and look too compact (you can't see how long ago a project was modifed anymore, and you can only see 10 projects at a time, breaking the view, and the sorting options. It wasn't broken Microsoft, why did you bring out the sledgehammer? - This actually really upset me yesterday (August 3rd 2021) but I didn't mention it until today (August 5th 2021)

* 4.1 - Description from August 11th 2021: Crappy layout, no borders, harder to browse and navigate, clunky, not as good, not necessary

* 4.2 - Update: modification times were added back, this is good, but the layout is still bad, and needs an API change. - ~August 9th 2021

* 5. The editor now auto collapses and auto expands while editing files, instead of remaining fixed with a scrollbar - August 11th 2021

> Followup

> This issue was fixed on 2021 September 13th, no more intense CPU spikes!

* 5.1 I am not used to it yet

* 6. The `Code` button shrunk and its icon was removed, thus the feature was de-emphasized, although functionality remains the same... for now. - August 11th 2021

* 7. Performance is getting worse and has been draining my battery (August 26th to August 27th 2021)

* 8. GitHub tag/release publishing got worse, and now requires you to use a dropdown to create the tag, which makes it difficult to do other things or look for information to help you build the tag, it is only getting more locked down. I am tired of all the dropdowns on GitHub (~2021 August 30th)

* 9. [BUG] Since 2021 September 22nd, the sponsor button on every project disappears upon creating, uploading a file, or refreshing the page. The issue has still not been fixed as of 2021 September 23rd.

**What is the 25 project limit**

* GitHub only displays daily activity for the top 25 projects I work on for that day or month. Any future project will bury a project under the list, and it won't be part of the list.

I have decided to start listing things I like about GitHub, as I don't want a fully negative experience.

<!-- Make a list of all the things you like about GitHub !-->

* 1. I like the GitHub linguist and its color codes. Ruby in dark mode reminds me of a certain part of my childhood

* 2. There are some skeuomorphic/detailed elements, and it is not all flat and boring. It seems like new skeuomorphic elements are being added (as of July 14th 2021)

* 3. There is some unique dialogue when an error happens, such as "yowsa, thats a lot of files"

* 4. Linux, BSD, MacOS, and other non-Windows support is available, along with support for various browsers. It isn't locked into just Google Chrome, and the site follows WHATWG web standards

* 5. The community is a lot friendlier and more professional (at least 100x) when compared to that of a site like YouTube

* 6. The site does a good job at tracking problems and fixing them

* 7. The site implements the Git version control system well

* 8. README Indexes are really neat, I really liked when they were introduced.

* 9. The site has a dark mode, but the people at GitHub went the extra mile and kept light mode, and even added a dark mode that is slightly dimmed for people who prefer it

* 10. The animation at the homepage is pretty cool, although a bit CPU intensive on Linux (like most other things, as my current computer has a poor GPU)

* 11. The "Secret" username/username repository is a good feature

* 12. August 25th 2021 redesign: the redesign actually made the site better

* 13. 2021 August 27th: A high contrast option was added for Dark mode, it is nice how many features are being added

* 14. Change to GitHub: public, private, public archive labels added to repo, still no option for archived and template at the same time. Not the worst change, but the site is changing so rapidly it is really hard to keep up - 2021 September 8th

* 15. I have been using my GitHub_Organization_Info repo as a reference, it has been really helpful starting yesterday (Tuesday, 2021 September 8th)

![https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Media/GitHub/Octocat/Loading/mona-loading-default.gif](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Media/GitHub/Octocat/Loading/mona-loading-default.gif)

* 16. GitHub added this cool new animation for the activity feed while it is loading, a new mona (:octocat:) animation.

* 17. Today, I got to test GitHubs new UI features, such as a mode for colorblind people. I myself am not colorblind, but @inverno4 is along with the rest of the 8% of colorblind people in the world. I hope that this improvement can make it easier for people to get the most out of the world. It is also nice to go from green to blue, and red to brown for a while (may be permanent) it is still a beta feature, so there is still a lot to change. I honestly thought a lot more would change, but as said earlier, the only things I can find are the transition from green to blue and from red to brown, the GitHUb Linguist being an exception to this. - 2021 September 30TH

* 18. There are 6 different visual themes on GitHUb now. Less than a year ago, there was only light mode. I like these changes

* 19. Another smaller but wholesome feature was the introduction of a confetti animation, and a extra-temporary dialob box about creating your first issue/discussuon in a project. I like these new changes. - 2021 September 29th

> Update (2021 September 30th) I recorded a video of the confetti animation and uploaded it to [seanpm2001/seanpm2001/Media/...](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Media/Videos/GitHub/2021/Confetti/GitHub_Confetti_2021September30th_WacOS_Cloud_1080p.webm)

* 20. You can now natively view the source code of a README file without viewing it raw or editing it, and switch back and forth between source code and rich text (noticed in Markdown, previously, I only noticed this in SVG files) - First spotted: 2021 September 28th

* 21. More entries coming soon

Here is a list of things I am neutral on:

* 1. Wiki pages ask if you want to see more pages after it lists the first 15. It will not ask you to see pages 46-60 then 61-75 and so on with further dialog.

* 2. Repository searching through the homepage is a bit clunkier now, as the username turns into a circular icon that is applied to all entries, rather than a link list (first noticed: 2021 September 28th)

#### Summer vacation #1

Ended, back home. See past status updates for more info.

#### Audio database framework update J2021

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I made no progress on this goal today. - June 26th 2021

#### Gitattributes

I learned a new trick with `.gitattribute` files on Sunday, June 13th 2021, from snooping around at Apple. I found that you can force the GitHub linguist to list Markdown or another non-programming language as a project language, here is how I did it:

##### Markdown Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

On Monday, June 15th 2021, I tested this trick for MediaWiki, which GitHub recognizes as WikiText. Here is the `.gitattributes` sample file used:

##### WikiText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.wiki linguist-detectable=true
*.wiki linguist-documentation=false
```

Also:

##### YAML Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.yml linguist-detectable=true
*.yml linguist-documentation=false
*.yaml linguist-detectable=true
*.yaml linguist-documentation=false
```

##### ReStructuredText Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.rst linguist-detectable=true
*.rst linguist-documentation=false
```

##### WebVTT Gitattributes

```gitattributes
*.vtt linguist-detectable=true
*.vtt linguist-documentation=false
```

##### KiXtart Gitattributes (unsuccessful)

```gitattributes
*.kix linguist-detectable=true
*.kix linguist-documentation=false
```

I have not tested any other languages, I am still trying to test .svg .gitattributes .gitignore and .txt

#### Giving ProtonMail a 2nd chance

I am still very upset with ProtonMail, but I have decided to give them a second chance today, and try to work through some issues via movements, and contacting the people at the lovely Switzerland office. I will get into contacts with ProtonMail, and learn this new mess of a UI.

As of 2021 September 19th, I have not tried ProtonMail again since the last login. I am extremely disappointed, as I may have permanently lost contact with a friend due to this.

#### Maintainers

Currently, I am the only maintainer for my GitHub projects. I am looking for new maintainers at the moment. I can't do all this by myself.

I am really looking for maintainers. I will train you myself if needed, but I only want people who enjoy doing it/really want to do it.

Maintenance is needed on my projects. I will get each project ready for maintenance by you or someone else. Please _**@**_ me for the training course.

On June 21st 2021, I made a repository outlining the beginning of my maintainer guidelines. You can view it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Maintainers-info)

#### Other tasks/the todo list

I have more new plans for work, and 45+ pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier.

I have been working off a todo list today, I did not make much progress on it today. - June 23rd 2021

The todo list has been getting scattered development, most easy and medium tasks are being done, but not large or immersive projects - June 26th 2021

#### Year In Review GitHub Year 1 progress

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I didn't make any progress on this goal today - July 3rd 2021

I haven't made progress on this in months. - July 14th 2021

Still abandoned - July 15th 2021 to August 30th 2021

#### Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo

**As part of a cleanup process of this status post, entries before July 4th 2021 have been removed. They can be found in older entries.**

I failed to catch up on MB/DDG work today - July 4th 2021

I still did not catch up on MB/DDG image work today. - July 5th 2021

I caught up on MB/DDG image work tonight. I have been noticing a pattern of me falling behind on this, then catching up every 3 days. I would like to have it be a daily thing, but if it is normal for my mind and workload, this fine. - July 6th 2021

I did not catch up today, but I did add new data, relating to a theory I had on the possible existence of the original lifeforms of this planet (that they may still be alive, and what we could learn from them if we managed to explore the ocean and possibly find them) and also fishtank specifications. - July 7th 2021

#### The future of TRM

Currently, my brand names have 3 layers

Ancient: TRM (2015-2018) (August 3rd 2021-present)

Medieval: Seanwallawalla (2015-2018) (partially: 2020-present)

Modern: Seanpm2001 (2020-present)

TRM has been mostly abandoned for several years, with the exception of the TRM brand being defined and documented in 2020, and 2021. It has mostly just been a TeamTDM ripoff, and hasn't been used seriously since 2018. I decided to change the acronym today (August 3rd 2021) from:

**T**he

I**r**on

**M**elon

(it has technically just been Tim this whole time)

to:

**T**he

**R**eal

**M**yrick

The name was recommended by my Dad, and is a reference to the metaphor [The Real McCoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_real_McCoy) the original acronym might be archived into the name T-TIM (Team: The Iron Melon)

#### Vexillology work

I have been planning this for a few days, but I now plan on hosting a mirror of the site FOTW.info which is one of the top Vexillology (study of flags) sites. Today, I decided it would be too cumbersome to do by hand every day/week/month, so I have started work on getting the project automated. There is still work to go on this.

#### Wrapping up

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

#### Clean slate

Next clean slate is ready on September 1st 2021.

#### And finally...

Today was a better day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I was wearing down while putting the finishing touches on this status post. I can't go any further today unfortunately. I really want to do more.

#### Miscellaneous notes

Note: these status posts have gotten very long. It is similar, but not the same to how much content is put into my daily journal/journaling.

Starting with the January 12th 2021, subheaders will now be included in status files. They help me organize the content better.

I am trying to burn this into my brain, as I forget sometimes when asked about my projects, which is:

"don't ever be afraid to be yourself, as being yourself is all of who you are"

and also:

"if you try to be someone you are not, you will be found out as a fraud in the future"

People don't usually forget this, but I need to give this advice to myself, as I sometimes forget it when asked about what my projects are and what they do.

These status posts are going to be shortened eventually, I am still figuring out how to do so in a clean manner.
