Currently, only a 3D variant of the project exists. If possible, the SNU dimensional converter will make a 2D version in the future, if it meets the guidelines of conversion. There will never be a 1D, or 0D variant. There will be a 4D variant though.
The dimensional mode of the project is not included in the organization name, as it is not necessary. Also, there will be multiple dimensional modes mirrored here, so it would be counter-productive, as I would then need to make SNU-2D-Universe, SNU-3D-Universe, SNU-4D-Universe, and so on for every single SNU project. The only organizations with the dimensions in its name are the dimension organizations themselves, which (SNU-2D for example) includes a mirror of every 2D SNU project.
