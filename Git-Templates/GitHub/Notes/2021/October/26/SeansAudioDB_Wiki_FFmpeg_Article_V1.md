# FFMPEG

## Audio

FFMPEG is a powerful and rich library of video, image, and audio codec tools that is used by many projects for playback and viewing of images, audio, and video.

## Personal use

### As a keyword

FFMPEG is my most frequently typed keyword in 2021 (my previous one was Firefox) I type it very frequently, and out of habit will use the letter `F` to try and find FFMPEG, or to just start writing it.
