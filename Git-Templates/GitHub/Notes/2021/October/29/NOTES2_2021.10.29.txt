Recent audio conversion

I have recently discovered album customizations on VLC Media Player, and it has inspired a new phase of exporting and updating my music collection with audio only equivalents of some songs. Some songs are up to ~2000x smaller without the music video.

Don't worry, I didn't delete the original files. The original video only, video with audio, and audio only versions are still there.

This is my big step in switching over to the SLIM I audio system, which will give me additional storage space, and make the collection more portable. I am hoping to be able to fit the entire collection on a single 128 gigabyte (or smaller, likely not smaller than 48 gigabytes) MicroSD card, rather than on a 400 Gigabyte MicroSD card.
