Why is 32 bit software not compliant?

32 bit support is not compliant, as it fails on the compliance for time and date, since a 32 bit system has a maximum of ~10000 years. Although this won't affect the current generation too much, one of the compliance goals requires software to work indefinitely, and since 64 bit software has a maximum of 18446744073709551616 seconds (or 5.04009400921026e+16 years)
