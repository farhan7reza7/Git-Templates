Why I quit early today
I am undergoing severe mental problems regarding changes to my anti-depressants. Today was the worst yet, which is why I had to quit early.
I have been undergoing severe existential crisises, and it completely crippled me today. I have felt intoxicated, dizzy, and mentally terrified. I am hoping the issue clears soon, but I fear having a heart attack and dying later in my life due to this prolonged stress. I want to reach out right now to people with depression, we should form a support group.  
No, you do not need to call the police, I have several people who care about me, are helping me and supporting me, and I really can't fathom what life would be without them.
I have broken down 5 times today (as of 9:45 pm) and I will be going to bed earlier tonight. I fixed an issue with my sleeping situation, so I hope I don't suffer anymore in the next 24 hours. I really just don't want to be in pain anymore, every time I see a face, I think of death and every one of my negative thoughts cycles through my head for 20 minutes. I don't want to hurt you (the reader) either, so try not to let this upset you too much. I have dealt with similar problems before. I have been fighting depression for over a decade.
To remind myself, today wasn't a complete failure. All the time spent on the template isn't showing up on my commit calendar, as it was done on 11 different branches, but you (me) did well today, over 100 commits aren't showing up, if that helps.
Tomorrow should be a better day. If not, I will update you. I am not going anywhere.
