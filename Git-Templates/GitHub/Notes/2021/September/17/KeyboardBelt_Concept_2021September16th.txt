Laptop keyboard solution: a key belt stache : a 4 part frame that wraps around the lower body of the laptop, and lets you mount a keyboard 2-8 centimeters above the original (EXTRA: For newer models: expand the keyboard up as much as needed) connected by hinges, NOT made of wood, but some other material.
Cons:
Slightly harder to hold
Bluetooth is now a dependency, if Bluetooth fails, you either have to restart/debug or go back to your broken keyboard to try and get it fixedA
