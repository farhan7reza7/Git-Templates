# .github folder Notes

## Before March 17th 2021

_No data currently available._

## March 17th 2021

1. Despite the hidden directory `.dirname` upload bugs presence on other directories, it is not in effect on the `.github` folder

## March 18th 2021

1. Do not make a README file in this directory, as it will display as the main README.md file for the project. Don't even do this on purpose, as the README file for the project needs to remain universal across all platforms (the issue was not fixed on purpose on 1 repository for temporary demonstration purposes in screenshots)

2. Seanpm2001/seanpm2001 is one of the first impression repositories for my work, so it gets to have all the possible data for `.github` including exclusive overall notes (like the current file)

## After March 18th 2021
