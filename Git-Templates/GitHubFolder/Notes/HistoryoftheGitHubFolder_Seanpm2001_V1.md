# History of the .github folder in my projects

This file goes over the development history of the `.github` folder in my projects.

## Before March 14th 2021

The folder was not mandatory, and was rarely used

## March 14th 2021

The folder is now being used on main projects, with sponsor info, and issue/discussion archival

Few repositories received the updates today, discussion and issue archival was done, but no markdown documentation was created yet

## March 15th 2021

A new privacy policy was added to discussion and issue directories, although issue directories weren't mandatory yet.

## March 16th 2021

No new changes were made to the protocols today, but more repositories were added to the protocol.

## March 17th 2021

A social media preview directory was added.

Issue data labels became mandatory in `/issues`

Social media previews became mandatory

The issue directory became mandatory, even with no archivable issues, with README.md, README_V.md, and GitHub_Default_IssueLabels.yaml

## March 18th 2021

Some instances of the social media preview directory now contain an `unused` directory for images I wanted to use, but couldn't use due to issues.

The seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository was declared a first impression repository, and its `.github` folder was maxed out with the current API level

A README.md file was added to the Funding directory, containing sponsor info and info about the directory

A README.md file was added to the root of the `.github` directory, but was renamed `.github_README.md` due to a conflict with the main repository README file

## March 19th 2021

_Coming soon!_
