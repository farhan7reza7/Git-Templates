  # Project language file 1
  # For: seanpm2001/WichCraft
  # About:
  # I decided to have Gherkin as the 1st project language for this project (WichCraft) as it is the most suitable programming language name for this project, as a Gherkin is something very commonly found in sandwiches and burgers. It is also a very functional language. It is being written in Gherkin both for software diversity reasons, and as a challenge. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."
