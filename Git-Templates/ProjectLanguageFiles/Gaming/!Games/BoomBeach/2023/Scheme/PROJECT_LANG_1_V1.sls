;; About:
;; Boom Beach is closed source, and I don't know what language it is written in, so I chose the one programming language with the name of something commonly done (scheming) and added this file, as I want this project to have a language assigned to it, so I wrote this file in Scheme. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
