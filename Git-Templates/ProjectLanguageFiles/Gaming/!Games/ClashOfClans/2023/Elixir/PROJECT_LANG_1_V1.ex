# About:
# Clash of Clans is closed source, and I don't know what language it is written in (my closest guess is ActionScript, as it was reported to originally be written in that language) s so I chose the one programming language with the name of an in-game currency (elixir) and added this file, as I want this project to have a language assigned to it, so I wrote this file in Elixir. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
