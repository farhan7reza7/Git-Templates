# Project Language Files

This directory hosts my various project language files, a tool and vanity piece in my projects that tells you what the primary languages that the project uses are. It is then reported to the GitHub Linguist, giving you the percentage of each programming language used.

## Note

Note: these files are just a vanity piece, and will not affect the performance or usability of any projects that contain them. If you don't want them in your own copy, just delete/move them, I guarantee it will not cause harm doing this by itself.

## Old system

The old project language file system (used up until Monday, July 12th 2021) was a set of 3 directories:

1. [Gaming](/Git-Templates/ProjectLanguageFiles/Gaming/)

2. [Tools](/Git-Templates/ProjectLanguageFiles/Tools/)

3. [Other](/Git-Templates/ProjectLanguageFiles/Other/)

It got expanded briefly in its last weeks:

4. [GitHub-Pages](/Git-Templates/ProjectLanguageFiles/GitHub-Pages/)

5. [Snapcraft](/Git-Templates/ProjectLanguageFiles/Snapcraft/)

Before being completely overhauled later in the day on Monday, July 12th 2021, to include a total of 45 directories and growing.

## Expanded system A

**Monday, June 12th 2021 - present**

The new system was expanded to on Monday, July 12th 2021. It is going to take some getting used to, and may need to be trimmed further.

**This list is incomplete**

I don't have the time to work on it tonight.
