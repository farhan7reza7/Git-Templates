# Snapcraft project language files

## About

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the about (lead) section</p></summary>

This directory is for hosting project language files for my snapcraft platform projects.

I have decided on July 11th 2021 to put project language files in my snapcraft projects, so that I could better account for all of them, and categorize them, without having to constantly keep tabs on them.

The process of adding them took just 2 days, I struggled originally, and was thinking of 2-3 a day over 5-7 days, but ended up finishing all of it in a 2 day period.

( [See my collection of Snapcraft projects here](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Snapcraft/) | [Make a snapcraft project with my V5 Snapcraft template](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Snapcraft-template_V5/) )

There are far fewer Snapcraft projects than there are GitHub Pages projects. [Click/tap here to view my GitHub Pages projects](/Git-Templates/ProjectLanguageFiles/GitHub-Pages/).

## TODO

I have deciced to put project language files in my snapcraft projects, so that I could better account for all of them, and categorize them, without having to constantly keep tabs on them.

I have 16 project language files to create before I am caught up. Once done, a `README.md` file and a `/!DOCS/` directory similar to the one in the GitHub Pages project language file directory will be created here.

I am expected to be finished and ready to do this by by July 12th to July 14th 2021.
