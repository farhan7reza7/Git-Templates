# Snapcraft project language files

## TODO

I have deciced to put project language files in my snapcraft projects, so that I could better account for all of them, and categorize them, without having to constantly keep tabs on them.

I have 16 project language files to create before I am caught up. Once done, a `README.md` file and a `/!DOCS/` directory similar to the one in the GitHub Pages project language file directory will be created here.

I am expected to be finished and ready to do this by by July 12th to July 14th 2021.
