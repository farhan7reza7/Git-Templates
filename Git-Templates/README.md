# Git-Templates (as of March 24th 2021)

This is my directory that houses my GitHub template data.

Data is sorted into 14 categories and 3 sub-categories:

<!-- I just had to go through and edit this list again, as apparently commenting before the text breaks the formatting. Original planned release date: Wednesday, March 24th 2021 at 6:51 pm !-->

**Batch uploads** - A set of files to use when writing descriptions for batch uploads that go 100 uploads at a time (up to a maximum batch of 5000 files, or 50 upload commits) <!-- 01 !--> 

**CONTRIBUTING** - A collection of the various versions and variations of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file used on various projects. <!-- 02 !--> 

**Commit** - A set of other commit descriptions and titles. <!-- 03 !--> 

**Discussions** - Data for starting and editing GitHub discussions. <!-- 04 !--> 

**File creation** - Houses my infamous `IGNORE.md` file that I use to create folders/directories on GitHub without uploading files. One of my most used files on GitHub, especially in 2020. <!-- 05 !--> 

**Gaming schedule** - An archive of the different versions of my gaming schedule Gist, I am not sure why it is here, as it doesn't really belong. <!-- 06 !--> 

**GitHub** - Older data for the `.github` folder. To be upgraded soon. <!-- 07 !--> 

**GitHub Folder** - Newer data for the `.github` folder to be merged with the preceding entry on this list. Also holds daily notes related to GitHub work. <!-- 08 !--> 

**NimbleBit** - Data related to NimbleBit projects. Needs to be merged elsewhere. <!-- 09 !--> 

**Policies** - A set of policies used on projects for liability, warranty, and other purposes. <!-- 10 !--> 

**Project Language Files** - An archive of all the project language files used on projects. Project language files mark the official language of the project, and normally include a punny joke. <!-- 11 !--> 

This section is sorted into 3 subsections:

**Gaming** - For project language files on game-related projects. <!-- 11.1 !-->

**Tools** - For project language files on productive projects. <!-- 11.2 !-->

**Other** - For project language files on projects that don't fit the above 2 categories. <!-- 11.3 !-->

**ProjectWiki** - Data for project wiki pages for projects. <!-- 12 !--> 

**README** - For the creation of `README.md`files, and upgrading sections of `README.md` files. <!-- 13 !--> 

**Releases** - For information regarded to releasing versions of projects, and creating their release notes. <!-- 14 !--> 

This is a very useful resource for my work, and I use it heavily on a daily basis.
