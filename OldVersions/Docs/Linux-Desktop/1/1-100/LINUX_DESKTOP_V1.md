# Linux desktop

I used the term Linux desktop, as it seems like a permanent term, as I think I will use Linux on every device from now on. This may slightly be due to Linux elitism.

I feel like Linux Elitism isn't going to die out anytime soon. Linux has a ~5% desktop marketshare, and has many elitists, but operating systems like MacOS with a near ~20% desktop marketshare have elitists. There are even Windows elitists, despite Windows having nearly ~70% desktop market majority.
