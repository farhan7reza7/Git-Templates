Installing Seanpm2001/Git-Templates
---

Seanpm2001/Git-Templates currently doesn't require installation, it is just a collection of information and templates that help me with Git. It is part of the Seanpm2001 Life Archive project, and for proper "installation" the repository should be placed under /SeansLifeArchive/<yourInstalledVersion>/Extras/GitHub/Templates/

If you want to load the first project language file, you will need to have a Python IDE/Interpreter and a package of any version of the Python programming language prior to version 3.0

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in PNG format. Make sure your computer can handle images of 1920x200000/2560x1440/2560x1080/1920x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle JPG files.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, GIF, and JPG. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Most of the files are in over a hundred different programming languages. To view the ones you want, you will need the necessary programming package, and an IDE/Interpreter for it. There are too many to list here, and many don't always function. It is best to view their source code before running them (to see if they work, and to see if you are interested in them)

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.
